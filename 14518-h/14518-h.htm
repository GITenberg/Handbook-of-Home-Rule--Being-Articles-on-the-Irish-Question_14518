<p>Of the articles contained in this volume, those by Mr.
Gladstone, Mr. E.L. Godkin on &quot;A Lawyer's Objections
to Home Rule,&quot; and Mr. Barry O'Brien appear
for the first time. The others are reprinted from the
<i>Contemporary Review</i>, the <i>Nineteenth Century</i>, and the
<i>New Princeton Review</i>, to the proprietors and editors of
which periodicals respectively the thanks of the several
writers and of the editor are tendered. In most of these
reprints some passages of transitory interest have been
omitted, and some few additions have been made.</p>

<p>The object of the writers has been to treat the difficult
questions connected with the Government of Ireland in a
dispassionate spirit; and the volume is offered to the public
in the hope that it may, at a time of warm controversy over
passing events, help to lead thoughtful men back to the
consideration of the principles which underlie those questions,
and which it seeks to elucidate by calm discussion
and by references to history.</p>

<p>The present seems an excellent moment for bringing forward
the arguments in favour of a new policy for Ireland,
which are to be found in the articles contained in this
volume.</p>

<p>We are realizing the first results of the verdict given
at the election of 1886. And this I interpret as saying
that the constituencies were not then ready to depart from
the lines of policy which, up to last year, nearly all politicians
of both parties in Parliament had laid down for their
guidance in Irish affairs.</p>

<p>We have had the Session occupied almost wholly with
Lord Salisbury's proposals for strengthening the power of
the central Government to maintain law and order in Ireland,
and for dealing with the most pressing necessities of the
Land question in that country.</p>

<p>It is well, before the policy of the Government is
practically tested, that the views of thoughtful men holding
different opinions should be clearly set forth, not in the
shape of polemical speeches, but in measured articles which
specially appeal to those who have not hitherto joined the
fighting ranks of either side, and who are sure to intervene
with great force at the next election, when the Irish question
is again submitted to the constituencies.<!-- Page viii --><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii" /></p>

<p>I feel that I can add little or nothing to the weight of
the arguments contained in these papers, but I should like
to give some reasons why I earnestly hope that they will
receive careful consideration.</p>

<p>The writers have endeavoured to approach their work
with impartiality, and to free themselves from those prejudices
which make it difficult for Englishmen to discuss
Irish questions in a fresh and independent train of thought,
and realize how widely Irish customs, laws, traditions, and
sentiments differ from our own.</p>

<p>We are apt to think that what has worked well here
will work well in Ireland; that Irishmen who differ from
us are unreasonable; and that their proposals for change
must be mistaken. We do not make allowance for the
soreness of feeling prevailing among men who have long
objected to the system by which Ireland has been governed,
and who find that their earnest appeals for reform have
been, until recent times, contemptuously disregarded by
English politicians. Time after time moderate counsels
have been rejected until too late. Acts of an exceptional
character intended to secure law and order have been very
numerous, and every one of them has caused fresh irritation;
while remedial measures have been given in a manner
which has not won the sympathy of the people, because
they have not been the work of the Irish themselves, and
have not been prepared in their own way.</p>

<p>Parliament seems during the past Session to have fallen
into the same error. By the power of an English majority,
measures have been passed which are vehemently opposed
by the political leaders and the majority of the Irish nation,
and which are only agreeable to a small minority in Ireland.
This action can only succeed if the Irish can be persuaded
to relinquish the national sentiments of Home Rule; and yet
<!-- Page ix --><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix" />this was never stronger or more vigorous than at the present
time. It is supported by millions of Irish settled in America
and in Australia; and here I would say that it has often struck
me that the strong feeling of dissatisfaction, or, I might say,
of disaffection, among the Irish is fed and nurtured by the
marked contrast existing between the social condition of
large numbers of the Irish in the South and West of Ireland
and the views and habits of their numerous relatives in the
United States.</p>

<p>The social condition of many parts of Ireland is as
backward, or perhaps more backward, than the condition of
the rural population of England at the end of last or the
beginning of this century. The Irish peasantry still live
in poor hovels, often in the same room with animals;
they have few modern comforts; and yet they are in close
communication with those who live at ease in the cities and
farms of the United States. They are also imbued with all
the advanced political notions of the American Republic,
and are sufficiently educated to read the latest political
doctrines in the Press which circulates among them. Their
social condition at home is a hundred years behind their
state of political and mental culture. They naturally contrast
the misery of many Irish peasants with the position of
their relatives in the New World. This cannot but embitter
their views against English rulers, and strengthen
their leaning to national sentiments. Their national aspirations
have never died out since 1782. They have taken
various forms; but if the movements arising from them
have been put down, fresh movements have constantly
sprung up. The Press has grown into an immense power,
and its influences have all been used to strengthen the zeal for
Irish nationality, while, at the same time, the success of the
national movements in Italy, Hungary, Greece, and Germany
<!-- Page x --><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x" />have had the same effect. Lastly, the sentiment of Home
Rule has gained the sympathy of large bodies of electors in
the constituencies of Great Britain, and, under the circumstances,
it is difficult to suppose that, even if the country
remains quiet, constitutional agitation will vanish or the
Irish relinquish their most cherished ambition.</p>

<p>We hear, from men who ought to know something of
Ireland, that if the Land question is once settled, and dual
ownership practically abolished, the tenants will be satisfied,
and the movement for Home Rule will no longer find active
support in Ireland. Without going into the whole of this
argument, I should like to say two things: first, that I do
not know how a large scheme of Land Purchase can be
carried through Parliament with safety to Imperial interests
without establishing, at the same time, some strong Irish
Government in Dublin to act between the Imperial Government
and the tenants of Ireland; and, second, that the
feeling for Home Rule has a vitality of its own which will
survive the Land question, even if independently settled.</p>

<p>Home Rule is an expression of national feeling which
cannot be extinguished in Ireland, and the only safe method
of dealing with it is to turn its force and power to the
support of an Irish Government established for the management
of local Irish affairs. There are those who think that
this must lead to separation. I cannot believe in this
fear, for I know of no English statesman who looks upon
complete separation of Ireland from Great Britain as
possible. The geographical position of Ireland, the social
and commercial connection between the two peoples, renders
such a thing impossible. The Irish know this, and they
are not so foolish as to think that they could gain their
independence by force of arms; but I do not believe that
they desire it. They are satisfied to obtain the manage<!-- Page xi --><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi" />ment
of their own local affairs under the <i>&aelig;gis</i> of the flag
of England. The papers in this volume show how this
can be done with due regard to Imperial interests and the
rights of minorities.</p>

<p>I shall not enlarge on this part of the subject, but I wish
to draw attention to the working of the Irish Government,
and the position which it holds in the country, for it is through
its administration that the policy of the Cabinet will be carried
out. At the outset I feel bound to deprecate the exaggerated
condemnation which the &quot;Castle&quot; receives from its opponents.
It has its defects. Notwithstanding efforts of various
ministers to enlarge the circle from which its officials are
drawn, it is still too narrow for the modern development
of Irish society, and it has from time to time been recruited
from partisans without sufficient regard to the efficiency and
requirements of the public service. But, on the whole, its
members, taken as individuals, can well bear comparison
with those of other branches of the Civil Service. They
are diligent; they desire to do their duty with impartiality,
and to hold an even balance between many opposing interests
in Ireland. Whatever party is in office, they loyally
carry out the policy of their chiefs. They are, probably,
more plastic to the leadership of the heads of departments
than members of some English offices, and they are more
quickly moved by the influences around them. Sometimes
they may relapse into an attitude of indifference and
inertness if their chiefs are not active; but, on the other
hand, they will act with vigour and decision if they are led
by men who know their own minds and desire to be firm
in the government of the country.</p>

<p>When speaking of the chiefs of the Irish Civil Service, who
change according to the political party in office, we must not
overlook the legal officers, who exercise a most powerful
<!-- Page xii --><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii" />influence on Irish administration. They consist of the
Lord Chancellor, the Attorney and Solicitor General, and,
until 1883, there was also an officer called the Law Adviser,
who was the maid-of-all-work of Castle administration. In
England, those who hold similar legal offices take no part
in the daily administration of public affairs. The Lord
Chancellor, as a member of the Cabinet, takes his share in
responsibility for the policy of the Government. The law
officers are consulted in special cases, and take their part
from time to time in debates in the House of Commons.
In Ireland, however, the Chancellor is constantly consulted
by the Lord-Lieutenant on any difficult matter of administration,
and the Attorney and Solicitor General are in
constant communication with the Lord-Lieutenant, if he
carries out the daily work of administration, and with the
Chief and the Under Secretary.</p>

<p>Governments differ as to the use they make of these
officials. Some Governments have endeavoured to confine
their work to cases where a mere legal opinion has to be
obtained; but, when the country is in a disturbed state, even
these limited references become very frequent, and questions
of policy as well as of law are often discussed with the law
officers. It is needless to say that, with their knowledge of
Ireland and the traditions of Castle government (it is rare
that all the law officers are new to office, and, consequently,
they carry on the traditions from one Government to another),
they often exercise a paramount influence over the policy
of the Irish Government, and practically control it.</p>

<p>They are connected with the closest and most influential
order in Irish society&mdash;the legal order, consisting of the
judges and Bar of Ireland. This adds to the general
weight of their advice, but it has a special bearing when
cases of legal reform or administration are under considera<!-- Page xiii --><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii" />tion;
it then requires unwonted courage and independence
for the law officers of the Crown to support changes which
the lay members of the Government deem necessary.</p>

<p>I have known conspicuous instances of the exercise of
these high qualities by law officers enabling reforms to be
carried, but as a rule, particularly when the initiative of
legal reform is left to them, the Irish law officers do not
care to move against the feeling of the legal world in
Dublin. The lawyers, like other bodies, oppose the diminution
of offices and honours belonging to them, or of the funds
which, in the way of fees and salaries, are distributed among
members of the bar; and they become bitterly hostile to any
permanent official who is known to be a firm legal reformer.
It would be impossible for me not to acknowledge the great
service often done to the Government by the able men
who have filled the law offices, yet I feel that under certain
circumstances, when their influence has been allowed too
strongly to prevail, it has tended to narrow the views of the
Irish Government, and to keep it within a circle too narrow
for the altered circumstances of modern life.</p>

<p>The chief peculiarity of the Irish Administration is its
extreme centralization. In this two departments may be
mentioned as typical of the whole&mdash;the police and administration
of local justice.</p>

<p>The police in Dublin and throughout Ireland are under
the control of the Lord-Lieutenant, and both these forces
are admirable of their kind. They are almost wholly maintained
by Imperial funds. The Dublin force costs about
&pound;150,000 a year. The Royal Irish Constabulary costs
over a million in quiet, and a million and a half in disturbed
times. Local authorities have nothing to do with their
action or management. Local justice is administered by
unpaid magistrates as in England, but they have been
<!-- Page xiv --><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv" />assisted, and gradually are being supplanted, by magistrates
appointed by the Lord-Lieutenant and paid by the State.</p>

<p>This state of things arose many years ago from the want
of confidence between resident landlords and the bulk of
the people. When agrarian or religious differences disturbed
a locality the people distrusted the local magistrates, and by
degrees the system of stipendiary, or, as they are called,
resident magistrates, spread over the country. To maintain
the judicial independence and impartiality of these magistrates
is of the highest importance. At one time this was
in some danger, for the resident magistrates not only heard
cases at petty sessions, but, as executive peace officers, to
a very great extent took the control of the police in their
district, not only at riots, but in following up and discovering
offenders. Their position as judicial and executive officers
was thus very unfortunately mixed up. Between 1882 and
1883 the Irish Government did their utmost to separate
and distinguish between these two functions, and it is to be
hoped that the same policy has been and will be now continued,
otherwise grave mischief in the administration of
justice will arise. The existence of this staff of stipendiary
magistrates could not fail to weaken the influence of the
gentry in local affairs, and, at the same time, other causes
were at work to undermine still further their power. The
spread of education, the ballot, the extension of the franchise,
communication with America, all tended to strengthen
the political leaning of the tenants towards the National
party in Ireland, and to widen the political differences between
the richer and poorer classes in the country. The
result of this has been, that not only have even the best
landlords gradually lost their power in Parliamentary elections
and on elective boards, but the Government, which
greatly relied on them for support, has become isolated.</p>

<p><!-- Page xv --><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv" />The system of centralization is felt all over the country.
It was the cause of weakness in the disturbed years of 1880
and 1881, and, although the Irish Executive strengthened
themselves by placing officers over several counties, on
whom they devolved a great deal of responsibility, they did
not by these steps meet the real difficulty, which was that
everything that went wrong, whether as to police or magisterial
decisions, was attributed to the management of the
Castle.</p>

<p>In this country, local authorities and benches of
magistrates, quite independent of the Home Office, are
held responsible for mistakes in police action or irregularities
in local justice. The consequence is that there is
a strong buffer to protect the character and power of the
Home Office.</p>

<p>The absence of such protection in Ireland obviously
has a very prejudicial effect on the permanent influence and
popularity of the Irish Government. But as long as our
system of government from England exists, this centralization
cannot be avoided, for it would not be possible to
transfer the responsibility of the police to local representative
bodies, as they are too much opposed to the landlords
and the Government to be trusted when strong party differences
arise; nor, for the same reason, would it be possible
to fall back on local men to administer justice. The
fact is, that, out of the Protestant part of Ulster, the Irish
Government receives the cordial support of only the landed
proprietors, and a part of the upper middle classes in the
towns. The feeling of the mass of the people has been so
long against them that no change in the direction of trust in
any centralized government of anti-national character can be
expected.</p>

<p>It would be difficult, perhaps impossible, to find any<!-- Page xvi --><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi" />
Municipal Council, Boards of Guardians, or Local Boards,
in Leinster, Munster, or Connaught, whose members do
not consist of a majority of Nationalists. At nearly all
such assemblies, whenever any important political movement
takes place in the country, or when the Irish
Government take any action which is displeasing to the
Nationalists, resolutions are discussed and carried in a
spirit of sharp hostility to the Government.</p>

<p>In Parliamentary elections we also find clear evidence
of the strength of the Nationalists, and the extreme weakness
of their opponents. This is a test which those who accept
popular representative government cannot disregard, particularly
at an election when for the first time the new
constituencies were called upon to exercise the privileges
entrusted to them by Parliament. Such was the election of
1885, followed in 1886 by another General Election. In 1885
contests took place in most of the Irish constituencies.
They were between Liberals allied with Conservatives, and
Parnellites. In 1886 the contests were between those who
called themselves Unionists and Parnellites, and the Irish
policy of Mr. Gladstone was specially referred to the electors.</p>

<p>In regard to the number of members returned on the
two sides, the result of each election was almost identical,
but in 1886 there were fewer contests. We may, then,
assume that the relative forces of Parnellites and Unionists
were accurately represented at the election of 1885.
If we take the votes at the election of 1885 for candidates
standing as Nationalists, we shall find, roughly speaking,
that they obtained in round numbers about 300,000 votes,
and candidates who stood either as Liberals or Conservatives
about 143,000. But the case is really stronger than these
figures represent it, because in some constituencies the contests
were between Liberals and Conservatives, and there
<!-- Page xvii --><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii" />can be no doubt that in those constituencies a number of
Nationalist votes were given for one or both of such candidates&mdash;votes
which, therefore, would have to be deducted
from the 143,000, leaving a still heavier majority on the
Nationalist side.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1" /><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>If we look at individual constituencies, we find that in
South Kerry only 133 persons voted for the &quot;Unionist&quot;
candidate, while 2742 voted for the Nationalist. In six out
of seven constituencies in Cork where contests took place
27,692 votes were given for the Nationalists, and only 1703
for their opponents. In Dublin, in the division which may be
considered the West End constituency of the Irish metropolis,
the most successful man of commerce in Ireland, a leader
of society, whose liberality towards those in his employment
is only equalled by his munificence in all public works, was
defeated by over 1900 votes. He did not stand in 1886,
but his successor was defeated by a still larger majority.
These elections show the numbers in Ireland on which the
Government and those who oppose Mr. Parnell's policy
can count for support.</p>

<p>It is absurd to say that these results are caused by
terrorism exercised over the minds of the electors by
the agitators in Ireland; the same results occurred in every
part of three provinces, and in part of Ulster, and the
universality of the feeling proves the dominant feeling of
the Irish electors. They show the extreme difficulty, the
impossibility, of gaining that support and confidence which
a Government needs in a free country. As it is, the Irish
Government stands isolated in Ireland, and relies for support
solely on England. Is a policy opposed to national
feeling, which has been often, and by different Ministers,
<!-- Page xviii --><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii" />tried in Ireland, likely to succeed in the hands of a Government
such as I have described, and isolated, as I think
few will deny it to be? It is impossible in the long run
to maintain it. The roots of strength are wanting.</p>

<p>If we turn from Dublin to London, we do not find
greater prospects of success. Twice within fourteen months
Lord Salisbury has formed a Government. In 1885 his
Cabinet, on taking office, deliberately decided to rule
Ireland without exceptional laws; after a few months, they
announced that they must ask Parliament for fresh powers.
They resigned before they had defined their measures. But
within six months Lord Salisbury was once more Prime
Minister, and again commenced his administration by
governing Ireland under the ordinary law. This attempt
did not continue longer than the first, for when Parliament
met in 1887, preparations were at once made to carry the
Criminal Law Amendment Act, which occupied so large
a portion of the late Session.</p>

<p>This is not the action of men who have strong faith in
their principles. Nor can it be shown that the continuous
support so necessary for success will be given to this policy.
No doubt it may be urged that the operation of the Act
is not limited in duration; but, notwithstanding that, few
politicians believe that the constituencies of Great Britain
will long support the application of exceptional criminal
laws to any part of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>This would be wholly inconsistent with past experience
In relation to these measures, which points entirely the
other way; and the publication in English newspapers and
constant discussion on English platforms of the painful
incidents which seem, unfortunately, inseparable from a rigid
administration of the law in Ireland, together with the prolonged
debates, such incidents give rise to, in Parliament,
<!-- Page xix --><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix" />aggravate the difficulties of administration, and lead the
Irish people to believe that exceptional legislation will be
as short-lived in the future as it has been in the past.</p>

<p>It was this evidence of want of continuity of policy in
1885, and the startling disclosure of the weakness of the
anti-national party in Ireland at the election in the autumn
of that year, which finally convinced me that the time had come
when we could no longer turn to a mixed policy of remedial
and exceptional criminal legislation as the means of winning
the constituencies of that country in support of our old
system of governing Ireland. That system has failed for
eighty-six years, and obviously cannot succeed when worked
with representative institutions. As the people of Great
Britain will not for a moment tolerate the withdrawal of
representative government from Ireland, we must adopt
some new plan. What I have here written deals with
but a fragment of the arguments for Home Rule, some
of which are admirably set forth by the able men who
have written the articles to which this is the preface. I
earnestly wish that they may arrest the attention of many
excellent Irishmen who still cling to the old traditions
of English rule, and cause them to realize that the only
way of relieving their country from the intolerable uncertainty
which hangs over her commercial, social, and
political interests and paralyzes all efforts for the improvement
of her people, will be to form a Constitution supported
by all classes of the community. I trust that they will join
in this work before it is too late, for they may yet exercise
a powerful and salutary influence in the settlement of this
great question.<!-- Page xx --><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx" /><!-- Page 1 --><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1" /></p>

<h2><a name="AMERICAN_HOME_RULE" id="AMERICAN_HOME_RULE" />AMERICAN HOME RULE</h2>

<p class="author">BY E.L. GODKIN</p>


<p>American experience has been frequently cited, in the
course of the controversy now raging in England over the
Irish question, both by way of warning and of example.
For instance, I have found in the <i>Times</i> as well as in other
journals&mdash;the <i>Spectator</i>, I think, among the number&mdash;very
contemptuous dismissals of the plan of offering Ireland a
government like that of an American State, on the ground
that the Americans are loyal to the central authority, while
in Ireland there is a strong feeling of hostility to it, which
would probably increase under Home Rule. The Queen's
writ, it has been remarked, cannot be said to run in large
parts of Ireland, while in every part of the United States
the Federal writ is implicitly obeyed, and the ministers of
Federal authority find ready aid and sympathy from the
people. If I remember rightly, the Duke of Argyll has
been very emphatic in pointing out the difference between
giving local self-government to a community in which the
tendencies of popular feeling are &quot;centrifugal,&quot; and giving
it to one in which these tendencies are &quot;centripetal.&quot; The
inference to be drawn was, of course, that as long as Ireland
disliked the Imperial government the concession of Home
Rule would be unsafe, and would only become safe when
the Irish people showed somewhat the same sort of affection
<!-- Page 2 --><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2" />for the English connection which the people of the State
of New York now feel for the Constitution of the United
States.</p>

<p>Among the multitude of those who have taken part in
the controversy on one side or the other, no one has, so
far as I have observed, pointed out that the state of feeling
in America toward the central government with which the
state of feeling in Ireland towards the British Government
is now compared, did not exist when the American Constitution
was set up; that the political tendencies in America
at that time were centrifugal, not centripetal, and that the
extraordinary love and admiration with which Americans
now regard the Federal government are the result of eighty
years' experience of its working. The first Confederation
was as much as the people could bear in the way of surrendering
local powers when the War of Independence
came to an end. It was its hopeless failure to provide
peace and security which led to the framing of the present
Constitution. But even with this experience still fresh, the
adoption of the Constitution was no easy matter. I shall
not burden this article with historical citations showing
the very great difficulty which the framers of the Constitution
had in inducing the various States to adopt it,
or the magnitude and variety of the fears and suspicions
with which, many of the most influential men in all parts
of the country regarded it. Any one who wishes to
know how numerous and diversified these fears and suspicions
were, cannot do better than read the series of
papers known as &quot;The Federalist,&quot; written mainly by
Hamilton and Madison, to commend the new plan to the
various States. It was adopted almost as a matter of
necessity, that is, as the only way out of the Slough of
Despond in which the Confederation had plunged the
union of the States; but the objections to it which were
felt at the beginning were only removed by actual trial.<!-- Page 3 --><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3" />
Hamilton's two colleagues, as delegates from New York,
Yates and Lansing, withdrew in disgust from the Convention,
as soon as the Constitution was outlined, and did not
return. The notion that the Constitution was produced by
the craving of the American people for something of that
sort to love and revere, and that it was not bestowed on
them until they had given ample assurance that they would
lavish affection on it, has no foundation whatever in fact.
The devotion of Americans to the Union is, indeed, as
clear a case of cause and effect as is to be found in political
history. They have learned to like the Constitution because
the country has prospered under it, and because it has
given them all the benefits of national life without interference
with local liberties. If they had not set up a
central government until the centrifugal sentiment had disappeared
from the States, and the feeling of loyalty for a
central authority had fully shown itself, they would assuredly
never have set it up at all.</p>

<p>Moreover, it has to be borne in mind that the adoption
of the Constitution did not involve the surrender of any
local franchises, by which the people of the various States
set great store. The States preserved fully four-fifths of
their autonomy, or in fact nearly all of it which closely concerned
the daily lives of individuals. Set aside the post-office,
and a citizen of the State of New York, not engaged in foreign
trade, might, down to the outbreak of the Civil War, have
passed a long and busy life without once coming in contact
with a United States official, and without being made aware
in any of his doings, by any restriction or regulation, that
he was living under any government but that of his own
State. If he went abroad he had to apply for a United
States passport. If he quarrelled with a foreigner, or with
the citizen of another State, he might be sued in the Federal
Court. If he imported foreign goods he had to pay duties
to the collector of a Federal Custom-house. If he invented
<!-- Page 4 --><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4" />something, or wrote a book, he had to apply to the Department
of the Interior for a patent or a copyright. But how
few there were in the first seventy years of American history
who had any of these experiences! No one supposes, or
has ever supposed, that had the Federalists demanded any
very large sacrifice of local franchises, or attempted to set
up even a close approach to a centralized Government, the
adoption of the Constitution would have been possible.
If, for instance, such a transfer of both administration and
legislation to the central authority as took place in Ireland
after the Union had been proposed, it would have been
rejected with derision. You will get no American to argue
with you on this point. If you ask him whether he thinks
it likely that a highly centralized government could have
been created in 1879&mdash;such a one, for example, as Ireland
has been under since 1800&mdash;or whether if created it would
by this time have won the affection of the people, or filled
them with centripetal tendencies, he will answer you with
a smile.</p>

<p>The truth is that nowhere, any more than in Ireland,
do people love their Government from a sense of duty or
because they crave an object of political affection, or even
because it exalts them in the eyes of foreigners. They love
it because they are happy or prosperous under it; because
it supplies security in the form best suited to their tastes
and habits, or in some manner ministers to their self-love.
Loyalty to the king as the Lord's anointed, without any
sense either of favours received or expected, has played
a great part in European politics, I admit; but, for reasons
which I will not here take up space in stating, a political
arrangement, whether it be an elected monarch or a constitution,
cannot be made, in our day, to reign in men's
hearts except as the result of benefits so palpable that
common people, as well as political philosophers, can see
them and count them.</p>

<p><!-- Page 5 --><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5" />Many of the opponents of Home Rule, too, point to
the vigour with which the United States Government put
down the attempt made by the South to break up the
Union as an example of the American love of &quot;imperial
unity,&quot; and of the spirit in which England should now
meet the Irish demands for local autonomy. This again
is rather surprising, because you will find no one in
America who will maintain for one moment that troops
could have been raised in 1860 to undertake the conquest
of the South for the purpose of setting up a centralized
administration, or, in other words, for the purpose of wiping
out State lines, or diminishing State authority. No man or
party proposed anything of this kind at the outbreak of the
war, or would have dared to propose it. The object for
which the North rose in arms, and which Lincoln had in
view when he called for troops, was the restoration of the
Union just as it was when South Carolina seceded, barring
the extension of slavery into the territories. During the
first year of the war, certainly, the revolted States might at
any time have had peace on the <i>status quo</i> basis, that is, without
the smallest diminution of their rights and immunities
under the Constitution. It was only when it became
evident that the war would have to be fought out to a
finish, as the pugilists say&mdash;that is, that it would have to
end in a complete conquest of the Southern territory&mdash;that
the question, what would become of the States as a political
organization after the struggle was over, began to be
debated at all. What did become of them? How did
Americans deal with Home Rule, after it had been used
to set on foot against the central authority what the newspapers
used to delight in calling &quot;the greatest rebellion the
world ever saw&quot;? The answer to these questions is, it
seems to me, a contribution of some value to the discussion
of the Irish problem in its present stage, if American precedents
can throw any light whatever on it.</p>

<p><!-- Page 6 --><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6" />There was a Joint Committee of both Houses of Congress
appointed in 1866 to consider the condition of the
South with reference to the safety or expediency of admitting
the States lately in rebellion to their old relations to the
Union, including representation in Congress. It contained,
besides such fanatical enemies of the South as Thaddeus
Stevens, such very conservative men as Mr. Fessenden,
Mr. Grimes, Mr. Morrill, and Mr. Conkling. Here is the
account they gave of the condition of Southern feeling one
year after Lee's surrender:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Examining the evidence taken by your committee still
further, in connection with facts too notorious to be disputed,
it appears that the Southern press, with few exceptions,
and those mostly of newspapers recently established
by Northern men, abounds with weekly and daily abuse of
the institutions and people of the loyal States; defends the
men who led, and the principles which incited, the rebellion;
denounces and reviles Southern men who adhered to the
Union; and strives constantly and unscrupulously, by every
means in its power, to keep alive the fire of hate and discord
between the sections; calling upon the President to
violate his oath of office, overturn the Government by force
of arms, and drive the representatives of the people from
their seats in Congress. The national banner is openly
insulted, and the national airs scoffed at, not only by an
ignorant populace, but at public meetings, and once, among
other notable instances, at a dinner given in honour of
a notorious rebel who had violated his oath and abandoned
his flag. The same individual is elected to an important
office in the leading city of his State, although an unpardoned
rebel, and so offensive that the President refuses to allow
him to enter upon his official duties. In another State the
leading general of the rebel armies is openly nominated for
Governor by the Speaker of the House of Delegates, and
the nomination is hailed by the people with shouts of
satisfaction, and openly endorsed by the press....</p>

<p>&quot;<!-- Page 7 --><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7" />The evidence of an intense hostility to the Federal
Union, and an equally intense love of the late Confederacy,
nurtured by the war is decisive. While it appears that
nearly all are willing to submit, at least for the time being,
to the Federal authority, it is equally clear that the ruling
motive is a desire to obtain the advantages which will be
derived from a representation in Congress. Officers of the
Union army on duty, and Northern men who go south to
engage in business, are generally detested and proscribed.
Southern men who adhered to the Union are bitterly hated
and relentlessly persecuted. In some localities prosecutions
have been instituted in State courts against Union officers
for acts done in the line of official duty, and similar prosecutions
are threatened elsewhere as soon as the United
States troops are removed. All such demonstrations show
a state of feeling against which it is unmistakably necessary
to guard.</p>

<p>&quot;The testimony is conclusive that after the collapse of
the Confederacy the feeling of the people of the rebellious
States was that of abject submission. Having appealed to
the tribunal of arms, they had no hope except that by the
magnanimity of their conquerors, their lives, and possibly
their property, might be preserved. Unfortunately the
general issue of pardons to persons who had been prominent
in the rebellion, and the feeling of kindliness and
conciliation manifested by the Executive, and very
generally indicated through the Northern press, had the
effect to render whole communities forgetful of the crime
they had committed, defiant towards the Federal Government,
and regardless of their duties as citizens. The
conciliatory measures of the Government do not seem
to have been met even half-way. The bitterness and
defiance exhibited towards the United States under such
circumstances is without a parallel in the history of the
world. In return for our leniency we receive only an
<!-- Page 8 --><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8" />insulting denial of our authority. In return for our kind
desire for the resumption of fraternal relations we receive
only an insolent assumption of rights and privileges long
since forfeited. The crime we have punished is paraded
as a virtue, and the principles of republican government
which we have vindicated at so terrible a cost are denounced
as unjust and oppressive.</p>

<p>&quot;If we add to this evidence the fact that, although
peace has been declared by the President, he has not, to
this day, deemed it safe to restore the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>,
to relieve the insurrectionary States of martial law, nor to
withdraw the troops from many localities, and that the
commanding general deems an increase of the army indispensable
to the preservation of order and the protection of
loyal and well-disposed people in the South, the proof of
a condition of feeling hostile to the Union and dangerous
to the Government throughout the insurrectionary States
would seem to be overwhelming.&quot;</p>

<p>This Committee recommended a series of coercive
measures, the first of which was the adoption of the fourteenth
amendment to the Constitution, which disqualified
for all office, either under the United States or under any
State, any person who having in any capacity taken an oath
of allegiance to the United States afterwards engaged in
rebellion or gave aid and comfort to the rebels. This
denied the <i>jus honorum</i> to all the leading men at the South
who had survived the war. In addition to it, an Act was
passed in March, 1867, which put all the rebel States under
military rule until a constitution should have been framed
by a Convention elected by all males over twenty-one,
except such as would be excluded from office by the above-named
constitutional amendment if it were adopted, which
at that time it had not been. Another Act was passed
three weeks later, prescribing, for voters in the States lately
in rebellion, what was known as the &quot;ironclad oath,&quot; which
<!-- Page 9 --><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9" />excluded from the franchise not only all who had borne
arms against the United States, but all who, having ever
held any office for which the taking an oath of allegiance
to the United States was a qualification, had afterwards
ever given &quot;aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.&quot; This
practically disfranchised all the white men of the South
over twenty-five years old.</p>

<p>On this legislation there grew up, as all the world now
knows, what was called the &quot;carpet-bag&quot; <i>regime</i>. Swarms
of Northern adventurers went down to the Southern States,
organized the ignorant negro voters, constructed State constitutions
to suit themselves, got themselves elected to all
the chief offices, plundered the State treasuries, contracted
huge State debts, and stole the proceeds in connivance with
legislatures composed mainly of negroes, of whom the most
intelligent and instructed had been barbers and hotel-waiters.
In some of the States, such as South Carolina and Mississippi,
in which the negro population were in the majority,
the government became a mere caricature. I was in
Columbia, the capital of South Carolina, in 1872, during
the session of the legislature, when you could obtain the
passage of almost any measure you pleased by a small payment&mdash;at
that time seven hundred dollars&mdash;to an old negro
preacher who controlled the coloured majority. Under the
pretence of fitting up committee-rooms, the private lodging-rooms
at the boarding-houses of the negro members, in
many instances, were extravagantly furnished with Wilton
and Brussels carpets, mirrors, and sofas. A thousand dollars
were expended for two hundred elegant imported china
spittoons. There were only one hundred and twenty-three
members in the House of Representatives, but the residue
were, perhaps, transferred to the private chambers of the
legislators.</p>

<p>Now, how did the Southern whites deal with this state of
things? Well, I am sorry to say they manifested their
<!-- Page 10 --><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10" />discontent very much in the way in which the Irish have for
the last hundred years been manifesting theirs. If, as the
English opponents of Home Rule seem to think, readiness to
commit outrages, and refusal to sympathize with the victims
of outrages, indicate political incapacity, the whites of the
South showed, in the period between 1866 and 1876, that they
were utterly unfit to be entrusted with the work of self-government.
They could not rise openly in revolt because the
United States troops were everywhere at the service of the
carpet-baggers, for the suppression of armed resistance.
They did not send petitions to Congress, or write letters to
the Northern newspapers, or hold indignation meetings.
They simply formed a huge secret society on the model of
the &quot;Molly Maguires&quot; or &quot;Moonlighters,&quot; whose special
function was to intimidate, flog, mutilate, or murder political
opponents in the night time. This society was called the
&quot;Ku-Klux Klan.&quot; Let me give some account of its operation,
and I shall make it as brief as possible. It had
become so powerful in 1871 that President Grant in that
year, in his message to Congress, declared that &quot;a condition
of things existed in some of the States of the Union rendering
life and property insecure, and the carrying of the mails
and the collecting of the revenue dangerous.&quot; A Joint Select
Committee of Congress was accordingly appointed, early in
1872, to &quot;inquire into the condition of affairs in the late
insurrectionary States, so far as regards the execution of the
laws and the safety of the lives and property of the citizens
of the United States.&quot; Its report now lies before me, and
it reads uncommonly like the speech of an Irish Secretary
in the House of Commons bringing in a &quot;Suppression of
Crime Bill.&quot; The Committee say&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;There is a remarkable concurrence of testimony to the
effect that, in those of the late rebellious States into whose
condition we have examined, the courts and juries administer
justice between man and man in all ordinary cases, civil
<!-- Page 11 --><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11" />and criminal; and while there is this concurrence on this
point, the evidence is equally decisive that redress cannot
be obtained against those who commit crimes in disguise
and at night. The reasons assigned are that identification
is difficult, almost impossible; that, when this is attempted,
the combinations and oaths of the order come in and release
the culprit by perjury, either upon the witness-stand or in
the jury-box; and that the terror inspired by their acts, as
well as the public sentiment in their favour in many localities,
paralyzes the arm of civil power.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>&quot;The murders and outrages which have been perpetrated
in many counties of Middle and West Tennessee, during
the past few months, have been so numerous, and of such
an aggravated character, as almost baffles investigation. In
these counties a reign of terror exists which is so absolute
in its nature that the best of citizens are unable or unwilling
to give free expression to their opinions. The terror inspired
by the secret organization known as the Ku-Klux
Klan is so great, that the officers of the law are powerless
to execute its provisions, to discharge their duties, or
to bring the guilty perpetrators of these outrages to the
punishment they deserve. Their stealthy movements are
generally made under cover of night, and under masks and
disguises, which render their identification difficult, if not
impossible. To add to the secrecy which envelops their
operations, is the fact that no information of their murderous
acts can be obtained without the greatest difficulty and
danger in the localities where they are committed. No one
dares to inform upon them, or take any measures to bring
them to punishment, because no one can tell but that he
may be the next victim of their hostility or animosity. The
members of this organization, with their friends, aiders, and
abettors, take especial pains to conceal all their operations.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><!-- Page 12 --><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12" />&quot;Your committee believe that during the past six
months, the murders&mdash;to say nothing of other outrages&mdash;would
average one a day, or one for every twenty-four
hours; that in the great majority of these cases they have
been perpetrated by the Ku-Klux above referred to, and
few, if any, have been brought to punishment. A number
of the counties of this State (Tennessee) are entirely at the
mercy of this organization, and roving bands of nightly
marauders bid defiance to the civil authorities, and threaten
to drive out every man, white or black, who does not submit
to their arbitrary dictation. To add to the general lawlessness
of these communities, bad men of every description
take advantage of the circumstances surrounding them, and
perpetrate acts of violence, from personal or pecuniary
motives, under the plea of political necessity.&quot;</p>

<p>Here is some of the evidence on which the report was
based.</p>

<p>A complaint of outrages committed in Georgia was referred
by the general of the army, in June, 1869, to the
general of the Department of the South for thorough investigation
and report. General Terry, in his report, made
August 14, 1869, says<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2" /><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;In many parts of the State there is practically no
government. The worst of crimes are committed, and no
attempt is made to punish those who commit them. Murders
have been and are frequent; the abuse, in various ways, of
the blacks is too common to excite notice. There can
be no doubt of the existence of numerous insurrectionary
organizations known as 'Ku-Klux Klans,' who, shielded by
their disguise, by the secrecy of their movements, and by
the terror which they inspire, perpetrate crime with impunity.
There is great reason to believe that in some cases local
magistrates are in sympathy with the members of these
organizations. In many places they are overawed by them
<!-- Page 13 --><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13" />and dare not attempt to punish them. To punish such
offenders by civil proceedings would be a difficult task, even
were magistrates in all cases disposed and had they the
courage to do their duty, for the same influences which
govern them equally affect juries and witnesses.&quot;</p>

<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Lewis Merrill, who assumed command
(in Louisiana) on the 26th of March, and commenced
investigation into the state of affairs, says (p. 1465)&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;From the best information I can get, I estimate the
number of cases of whipping, beating, and personal violence
of various grades, in this county, since the first of last
November, at between three and four hundred, excluding
numerous minor cases of threats, intimidation, abuse, and
small personal violence, as knocking down with a pistol
or gun, etc. The more serious outrages, exclusive of
murders and whippings, noted hereafter, have been the
following:&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>He then proceeds with the details of sixty-eight cases,
giving the names of the parties injured, white and black,
and including the tearing up of the railway, on the night
before a raid was made by the Ku-Klux on the county
treasury building. The rails were taken up, to prevent the
arrival of the United States troops, who, it was known, were
to come on Sunday morning. The raid was made on that
Sunday night while the troops were lying at Chester,
twenty-two miles distant, unable to reach Yorkville, because
of the rails being torn up.</p>

<p>Another witness said: &quot;To give the details of the
whipping of men to compel them to change their mode of
voting, the tearing of them away from their families at night,
accompanied with insults and outrage, and followed by their
murder, would be but repeating what has been described in
other States, showing that it is the same organization in all,
working by the same means for the same end. Five
murders are shown to have been committed in Monroe<!-- Page 14 --><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14" />
County, fifteen in Noxubee, one in Lowndes, by the
testimony taken in the city of Washington; but the extent
to which school-houses were burnt, teachers whipped, and
outrages committed in this State, cannot be fully given
until the testimony taken by the sub-committee shall have
been printed and made ready to report.&quot;</p>

<p>There are about eighty, closely printed, large octavo
pages of this kind of testimony given by sufferers from the
outrages.</p>

<p>Something was done to suppress the Ku-Klux by a
Federal Act passed in 1871, which made offences of this
kind punishable in the Federal Courts. Considerable
numbers of them were arrested, tried, and convicted, and
sent to undergo their punishment in the Northern jails.
But there was no complete pacification of the South until
the carpet-bag governments were refused the support of the
Federal troops by President Hayes, on his accession to
power in 1876. Then the carpet-bag <i>r&eacute;gime</i> disappeared
like a house of cards. The chief carpet-baggers fled, and
the government passed at once into the hands of the native
whites. I do not propose to defend or explain the way in
which they have since then kept it in their hands, by
suppressing or controlling the negro vote. This is not
necessary to my purpose.</p>

<p>What I seek to show is that the Irish are not peculiar
in their manner of expressing their discontent with a
government directed or controlled by the public opinion
of another indifferent or semi-hostile community which it
is impossible to resist in open warfare; that Anglo-Saxons
resort to somewhat the same methods under similar circumstances,
and that lawlessness and cruelty, considered
as expressions of political animosity, do not necessarily
argue any incapacity for the conduct of an orderly and
efficient government, although I admit freely that they do
argue a low state of civilization.</p>

<p><!-- Page 15 --><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15" />I will add one more illustration which, although more
remote than those which I have taken from the Southern
States during the reconstruction period, is not too remote
for my purpose, and is in some respects stronger than any
of them. I do not know a more orderly community in the
world, or one which, down to the outbreak of the Civil
War, when manufactures began to multiply, and the Irish
immigration began to pour in, had a higher average of
intelligence than the State of Connecticut. Down to 1818
all voters in that State had to be members of the Congregational
Church. It had no large cities, and this, with the
aid of its seat of learning, Yale College, preserved in it, I
think, in greater purity than even Massachusetts, the old
Puritan simplicity of manners, the Puritan spirit of order and
thrift, and the business-like view of government which grew
out of the practice of town government. A less sentimental
community, I do not think, exists anywhere, or one in which
the expression of strong feeling on any subject but religion
is less cultivated or viewed with less favour. In the matter
of managing their own political affairs in peace or war, I do
not expect the Irish to equal the Connecticut people for a
hundred years to come, no matter how much practice they
may have in the interval, and I think that fifty years ago it
was only picked bodies of Englishmen who could do so.
Yet, in 1833, in the town of Canterbury, one of the most
orderly and intelligent in the State, an estimable and much-esteemed
lady, Miss Prudence Crandall, was carrying on a
girls' school, when something happened to touch her
conscience about the condition of the free negroes of the
North. She resolved, in a moment of enthusiasm, to
undertake the education of negro girls only. What follows
forms one of the most famous episodes in the anti-slavery
struggle in America, and is possibly familiar to many
of the older readers of this article. I shall extract the
account of it as given briefly in the lately published life of<!-- Page 16 --><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16" />
William Lloyd Garrison, by his sons. Some of the details
are much worse than is here described.</p>

<p>&quot;The story of this remarkable case cannot be pursued
here except in brief.... It will be enough to say that the
struggle between the modest and heroic young Quaker
woman and the town lasted for nearly two years; that the
school was opened in April; that attempts were immediately
made under the law to frighten the pupils away and to fine
Miss Crandall for harbouring them; that in May an Act
prohibiting private schools for non-resident coloured persons,
and providing for the expulsion of the latter, was procured
from the legislature, amid the greatest rejoicing in Canterbury
(even to the ringing of church bells); that, under this
Act, Miss Crandall was in June arrested and temporarily
imprisoned in the county jail, twice tried (August and
October) and convicted; that her case was carried up to
the Supreme Court of Errors, and her persecutors defeated
on a technicality (July, 1834), and that pending this
litigation the most vindictive and inhuman measures were
taken to isolate the school from the countenance and even
the physical support of the townspeople. The shops and
the meeting-house were closed against teacher and pupils,
carriage in the public conveyances was denied them, physicians
would not wait upon them, Miss Crandall's own
family and friends were forbidden, under penalty of heavy
fines, to visit her, the well was filled with manure and water
from other sources refused, the house itself was smeared
with filth, assailed with rotten eggs and stones, and finally
set on fire&quot; (vol. i. p. 321).</p>

<p>Miss Crandall is still living in the West, in extreme old
age, and the Connecticut legislature voted her a small
pension two years ago, as a slight expiation of the ignominy
and injustice from which she had suffered at the hands of
a past generation.</p>

<p>The <i>Spectator</i> frequently refers to the ferocious hatred
<!-- Page 17 --><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17" />displayed toward the widow of Curtin, the man who was
cruelly murdered by moonlighters somewhere in Kerry, as
an evidence of barbarism which almost, if not quite, justifies
the denial of self-government to a people capable of producing
such monsters in one spot and on one occasion.
Let me match this from Mississippi with a case which I
produce, not because it was singular, but because it was
notorious at the North, where it occurred, in 1877. One
Chisholm, a native of the State, and a man of good standing
and character, became a Republican after the war, and was
somewhat active in organizing the negro voters in his
district. He was repeatedly warned by some of his neighbours
to desist and abandon politics, but continued resolutely
on his course. A mob, composed of many of the
leading men in the town, then attacked him in his house.
He made his escape, with his wife and young daughter and
son, a lad of fourteen, to the jail. His assailants broke the
jail open, and killed him and his son, and desperately
wounded the daughter. The poor lad received such a
volley of bullets, that his blood went in one rush to the
floor, and traced the outlines of his trunk on the ceiling of
the room below, where it remained months afterwards, an
eye-witness told me, as an illustration of the callousness of
the jailer. The leading murderers were tried. They had
no defence. The facts were not disputed. The judge and
the bar did their duty, but the jury acquitted the prisoners
without leaving their seats. Mrs. Chisholm, the widow,
found neither sympathy nor friends at the scene of the
tragedy. She had to leave the State, and found refuge in
Washington, where she now holds a clerkship in the
Treasury department.</p>

<p>Let me cite as another illustration the violent ways in
which popular discontent may find expression in communities
whose political capacity and general respect for the law and
its officers, as well as for the sanctity of contracts, have never
<!-- Page 18 --><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18" />been questioned. Large tracts of land were formerly held
along the Hudson river in the State of New York, by a few
families, of which the Van Rensselaers and the Livingstons
were the chief, either under grants from the Dutch at the first
settlement of the colony, or from the English Crown after the
conquest. That known as the &quot;Manor of Rensselaerwick,&quot;
held by the Van Rensselaers, comprised a tract of country
extending twenty-four miles north and south, and forty-eight
miles east and west, lying on each side of the Hudson river.
It was held by the tenants for perpetual leases. The rents
were, on the Van Rensselaer estate, fourteen bushels of
wheat for each hundred acres, and four fat hens, and one
day's service with a carriage and horses, to each farm of
one hundred and sixty acres. Besides this, there was a fine
on alienation amounting to about half a year's rent. The
Livingston estates were let in much the same way.</p>

<p>In 1839, Stephen Van Rensselaer, the proprietor, or
&quot;Patroon&quot; as he was called, died, with $400,000 due to
him as arrears from the tenants, for which, being a man
of easy temper, he had forborne to press them. But he left
the amount in trust by his will for the payment of his debts,
and his heirs proceeded to collect it, and persisted in the
attempt during the ensuing seven years. What then happened
I shall describe in the words of Mr. John Bigelow.
Mr. Tilden was a member of the State Legislature in 1846,
and was appointed Chairman of a Committee to investigate
the rent troubles, and make the report which furnished the
basis for the legislation by which they were subsequently
settled. Mr. Bigelow, who has edited Mr. Tilden's <i>Public
Writings and Speeches</i>, prefaces the report with the following
explanatory note:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Attempts were made to enforce the collection of these
rents. The tenants resisted. They established armed
patrols, and, by the adoption of various disguises, were
enabled successfully to defy the civil authorities. Eventually
<!-- Page 19 --><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19" />it became necessary to call out the military, but the
result was only partially satisfactory. These demonstrations
of authority provoked the formation of 'anti-rent clubs'
throughout the manorial district, with a view of acquiring a
controlling influence in the legislature. Small bands, armed
and disguised as Indians, were also formed to hold themselves
in readiness at all times to resist the officers of the
law whenever and wherever they attempted to serve legal
process upon the tenants. The principal roads throughout
the infected district were guarded by the bands so carefully,
and the animosity between the tenants and the civil authorities
was so intense, that at last it became dangerous for
any one not an anti-renter to be found in these neighbourhoods.
It was equally dangerous for the landlords to make
any appeal to the law or for the collection of rents or for
protection of their persons. When Governor Wright entered
upon his duties in Albany in 1845, he found that the anti-rent
party had a formidable representation in the legislature,
and that the questions involved were assuming an almost
national importance.&quot;</p>

<p>The sheriff made gallant attempts to enforce the law,
but his deputies were killed, and a legal investigation in
which two hundred persons were examined, failed to reveal
the perpetrators of the crime. The militia were called out,
but they were no more successful than the sheriff. In the
case of one murder committed in Delaware County in 1845,
however, two persons were convicted, but their sentence
was commuted to imprisonment for life. Various others
concerned in the disturbances were convicted of minor
offences, but when Governor Young succeeded Governor
Seward after an election in which the anti-renters showed
considerable voting strength, he pardoned them all on the
ground that their crimes were political. The dispute was
finally settled by a compromise&mdash;that is, the Van Rensselaers
and the Livingstons both sold their estates, giving quit-claim
<!-- Page 20 --><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20" />deeds to the tenants for what they chose to pay, and the
granting of agricultural leases for a longer term than twelve
years was forbidden by the State Constitution of 1846.</p>

<p>This anti-rent agitation is described by Professor Johnston
of Princeton, in the <i>Cyclop&aelig;dia of Political Science</i>, as &quot;a reign
of terror which for ten years practically suspended the
operations of law and the payment of rent throughout the
district.&quot; Suppose all the land of the State had been held
under similar tenures; that the controversy had lasted one
hundred years; that the rents had been high; and that the
Van Rensselaers and the Livingstons had had the aid of
the Federal army in enforcing distraints and evictions, and
in enabling them to set local opinion at defiance, what do
you suppose the state of morals and manners would have
been in New York by this time? What would have been
the feelings of the people towards the Federal authority had
the matter been finally adjusted with the strong hand, in
accordance, not with the views of the people of the State,
but of the landholders of South Carolina or of the district
of Columbia? I am afraid they would have been terribly
Irish.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I know very well the risk I run, in citing all these precedents
and parallels, of seeming to justify, or at all events
to palliate, Irish lawlessness. But I am not doing anything
of the kind. I am trying to illustrate a somewhat trite
remark which I recently made: &quot;that government is a
very practical business, and that those succeed best in
it who bring least sentiment or enthusiasm to the conduct
of their affairs.&quot; The government of Ireland, like
the government of all other countries, is a piece of
business&mdash;a very difficult piece of business, I admit&mdash;and
therefore horror over Irish doings, and the natural and
human desire to &quot;get even with&quot; murderers and moonlighters,
by denying the community which produces them
<!-- Page 21 --><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21" />something it would like much to possess, should have no
influence with those who are charged with Irish government.
It is only in nurseries and kindergartens that we can give
offenders their exact due and withhold their toffee until they
have furnished satisfactory proofs of repentance. Rulers of
men have to occupy themselves mainly with the question
of drying up the sources of crime, and often, in order to
accomplish this, to let much crime and disorder go unwhipped
of justice.</p>

<p>With the state of mind which cannot bear to see any
concessions made to the Irish Nationalists because they are
such wicked men, in which so many excellent Englishmen,
whom we used to think genuine political philosophers, are
now living, we are very familiar in the United States. It
is a state of mind which prevailed in the Republican party
with regard to the South, down to the election of 1884, and
found constant expression on the stump and in the newspapers
in what is described, in political slang, as &quot;waving
the bloody shirt.&quot; It showed itself after the war in unwillingness
to release the South from military rule; then in
unwillingness to remove the disfranchisement of the whites
or to withdraw from the carpet-bag State governments the
military support without which they could not have existed
for a day; and, last of all, in dread of the advent of a
Democratic Federal Administration in which Southerners
or &quot;ex-rebels&quot; would be likely to hold office. At first the
whole Republican party was more or less permeated by these
ideas; but the number of those who held them gradually
diminished, until in 1884 it was at last possible to elect a
Democratic President. Nevertheless a great multitude witnessed
the entrance into the White House of a President
who is indebted for his election mainly to the States formerly
in rebellion, with genuine alarm. They feared from it something
dreadful, in the shape either of a violation of the rights
of the freedmen, or of an assault on the credit and stability
<!-- Page 22 --><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22" />of the Federal Government. Nothing but actual experiment
would have disabused them.</p>

<p>I am very familiar with the controversy with them, for I
have taken some part in it ever since the passage of the
reconstruction Acts, and I know very well how they felt, and
am sometimes greatly impressed by the similarity between
their arguments and those of the opponents of Irish Home
Rule. One of their fixed beliefs for many years, though it
is now extinct, was that Southerners were so bent on rebelling
again, and were generally so prone to rebellion, that the
awful consequences of their last attempt in the loss of life
and property, had made absolutely no impression on them.
The Southerner was, in fact, in their eyes, what Mr. Gladstone
says the Irishman is in the eyes of some Englishmen:
&quot;A <i>lusus natur&aelig;</i>; that justice, common sense, moderation,
national prosperity had no meaning for him; that all he
could appreciate was strife and perpetual dissension. It
was for many years useless to point out to them the severity
of the lesson taught by the Civil War as to the physical
superiority of the North, or the necessity of peace and quiet
to enable the new generation of Southerners to restore their
fortunes, or even gain a livelihood. Nor was it easy to
impress them with the inconsistency of arguing that it was
slavery which made Southerners what they were before they
went to war, and maintaining at the same time that the disappearance
of slavery would produce no change in their
manners, ideas, or opinions. All this they answered by
pointing to speeches delivered by some fiery adorer of &quot;the
lost cause,&quot; to the Ku-Klux outrages, to political murders,
like that of Chisholm, to the building of monuments to the
Confederate dead, or to some newspaper expression of
reverence for Confederate nationality. In fact, for fully ten
years after the close of the war the collection of Southern
&quot;outrages&quot; and their display before Northern audiences, was
the chief work of Republican politicians. In 1876, during
<!-- Page 23 --><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23" />the Hayes-Tilden canvass, the opening speech which furnished
what is called &quot;the key-note of the campaign&quot; was
made by Mr. Wheeler, the Republican candidate for the
Vice-Presidency, and his advice to the Vermonters, to whom
it was delivered, was &quot;to vote as they shot,&quot; that is, to go to
the polls with the same feelings and aims as those with which
they enlisted in the war.</p>

<p>I need hardly tell English readers how all this has
ended. The withdrawal of the Federal troops from the
South by President Hayes, and the consequent complete
restoration of the State governments to the discontented
whites, have fully justified the expectations of those who
maintained that it is no less true in politics than in physics,
that if you remove what you see to be the cause, the effect
will surely disappear. It is true, at least in the Western
world, that if you give communities in a reasonable degree
the management of their own affairs, the love of material
comfort and prosperity which is now so strong among all
civilized, and even partially civilized men, is sure in the long
run to do the work of creating and maintaining order; or,
as Mr. Gladstone has expressed it, in setting up a government,
&quot;the best and surest foundation we can find to build
on is the foundation afforded by the affections, the convictions,
and the will of men.&quot;</p>

<p class="author">BY JAMES BRYCE, M.P.</p>


<p>In the Home Rule contest of the last eighteen months no
argument has been more frequently used against the Liberal
party than the charge of sudden, and therefore, it would
seem, dishonest change of view. &quot;You were opposed to
an Irish Parliament at the election of 1880 and for some
time afterward; you are not entitled to advocate it in 1886.&quot;
&quot;You passed a Coercion Bill in 1881, your Ministry (though
against the protests of an active section of its supporters)
passed another Coercion Bill in 1882; you have no right
to resist a third such Bill in 1887, and, if you do, your
conduct can be due to nothing but party spite and revenge
at your own exclusion from office.&quot; Reproaches of this
kind are now the stock-in-trade, not merely of the ordinary
politician, who, for want of a case, abuses the plaintiff's
attorney, but of leading men, and, still more, of leading
newspapers, who might be thought bound to produce from
recent events and an examination of the condition of
Ireland some better grounds for the passion they display.
It is noticeable that such reproaches come more often from
the so-called Liberal Unionists than from the present
Ministry. Perhaps, with their belief that all Liberals are
unprincipled revolutionaries, the Tories deem a sin more
or less to be of small account. Perhaps a recollection of
<!-- Page 25 --><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25" />their own remarkable gyrations, before and after the General
Election of 1885, may suggest that the less said about the
past the better for everybody. Be the cause what it may,
it is surprising to find that a section commanding so much
ability as the group of Dissentient Liberals does, should rely
rather on the charge of inconsistency than on the advocacy of
any counter-policy of their own. It is not large and elevated,
but petty, minds that rejoice to say to an opponent (and
all the more so if he was once a friend), &quot;You must either
be wrong now, or have been wrong then, because you have
changed your opinion. I have not changed; I was right
then, and I am right now.&quot; Such an argument not only
dispenses with the necessity of sifting the facts, but it fosters
the satisfaction of the person who employs it. Consistency
is the pet virtue of the self-righteous, and the man who
values himself on his consistency can seldom be induced
to see that to shut one's eyes to the facts which time develops,
to refuse to reconsider one's position by the light they
shed, to cling to an old solution when the problem is substantially
new, is a proof, not of fortitude and wisdom, but
rather of folly and conceit.</p>

<p>Such persons may be left to the contemplation of their
own virtues. But there are many fair-minded men of both
political parties, or of neither, who, while acquitting those
Liberal members who supported Home Rule in 1886 and
opposed Coercion in 1887 of the sordid or spiteful motives
with which the virulence of journalism credits them, have
nevertheless been surprised at the apparent swiftness and
completeness of the change in their opinions. It would be
idle to deny that, in startling the minds of steady-going people,
this change did, for the moment, weaken the influence and
weight of those who had changed. This must be so. A
man who says now what he denied six years ago cannot
expect to be believed on his <i>ipse dixit</i>. He must set forth
the grounds of his conviction. He must explain how his
<!-- Page 26 --><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26" />views altered, and why reasons which formerly satisfied him
satisfy him no longer. It may be that the Liberal party
have omitted to do this as they ought. Occupied by warm
and incessant discussions, and conscious, I venture to
believe, of their own honesty, few of its members have been
at the trouble of showing what were the causes which
modified their views, and what the stages of the process
which carried them from the position of 1880 to that of
1886.</p>

<p>Of that process I shall attempt in the following pages
to give a sketch. Such a sketch, though mainly retrospective,
is pertinent to the issues which now divide the country.
It will indicate the origin and the strength of the chief
reasons by which Liberals are now governed. And, if
executed with proper fairness and truth, it may, as a study
in contemporary history, be of some little interest to those
who in future will attempt to understand our present conflict.
The causes which underlie changes of opinion are
among the most obscure phenomena in history, because
those who undergo, these changes are often only half conscious
of them, and do not think of recording that which
is imperceptible in its growth, and whose importance is not
realized till it already belongs to the past.</p>

<p>The account which follows is based primarily on my
own recollection of the phases of opinion and feeling through
which I myself, and the friends whom I knew most intimately
in the House of Commons, passed during the Parliament
which sat from 1880 till 1885. But I should not
think of giving it to the public if I did not believe that
what happened to our minds happened to many others also,
and that the record of our own slow movement from the
position of 1880 to that of 1886 is substantially a record
of the movement of the Liberal party at large. We were
fairly typical members of that party, loyal to our leaders, but
placing the principles for which the Liberal party exists
<!-- Page 27 --><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27" />above the success of the party itself; with our share of
prepossessions and prejudices, yet with reasonably open
minds, and (as we believed) inferior to no other section
of the House of Commons in patriotism and in attachment
to the Constitution. I admit frankly that when we entered
Parliament we knew less about the Irish question than we
ought to have known, and that even after knowledge had
been forced upon us, we were more deferential to our
leaders than was good either for us or for them. But these
are faults always chargeable on the great majority of members.
It is because those of whom I speak were in these respects
fairly typical, that it seems worth while to trace the history
of their opinions. If any one should accuse me of attributing
to an earlier year sentiments which began to appear
in a later one, I can only reply that I am aware of this
danger, as one which always besets those who recall their
past states of mind, and that I have done my utmost to
avoid it.</p>

<p>The change I have to describe was slow and gradual.
It was reluctant&mdash;that is to say, it seemed rather forced
upon us by the teaching of events than the work of our
own minds. Each session marked a further stage in it;
and I therefore propose to examine its progress session by
session.</p>

<p>Session of 1880.&mdash;The General Election of 1880
turned mainly on the foreign policy of Lord Beaconsfield's
Government. Few Liberal candidates said much about
Ireland. Absorbed in the Eastern and Afghan questions,
they had not watched the progress of events in Ireland
with the requisite care, nor realized the gravity of the crisis
which was approaching. They were anxious to do justice
to Ireland, in the way of amending both the land laws and
local government, but saw no reason for going further.
Nearly all of them refused, even when pressed by Irish
electors in their constituencies, to promise to vote for that<!-- Page 28 --><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28" />
&quot;parliamentary inquiry into the demand for Home Rule,&quot;
which was then propounded by those electors as a sort
of test question. We (<i>i.e.</i> the Liberal candidates of 1880)
then declared that we thought an Irish Parliament would
involve serious constitutional difficulties, and that we saw
no reason why the Imperial Parliament should not do full
justice to Ireland. Little was said about Coercion. Hopes
were expressed that it would not be resorted to, but very
few (if any) pledged themselves against it.</p>

<p>When Mr. Forster was appointed Irish Secretary in
Mr. Gladstone's Government which the General Election
brought into power, we (by which I mean throughout the
new Liberal members) were delighted. We knew him to be
conscientious, industrious, kind-hearted. We believed him to
be penetrating and judicious. We applauded his conduct in
not renewing the Coercion Act which Lord Beaconsfield's
Government had failed to renew before dissolving Parliament,
and which indeed there was scarcely time left after
the election to renew, a fact which did not save Mr. Forster
from severe censure on the part of the Tories.</p>

<p>The chief business of the session was the Compensation
for Disturbance Bill, which Mr. Forster brought in for the
sake of saving from immediate eviction tenants whom a
succession of bad seasons had rendered utterly unable to
pay their rents. This Bill was pressed through the House
of Commons with the utmost difficulty, and at an expenditure
of time which damaged the other work of the session,
though the House continued to sit into September. The
Executive Government declared it to be necessary, in order
not only to relieve the misery of the people, but to secure
the tranquillity of the country. Nevertheless, the whole
Tory party, and a considerable section of the Liberal party,
opposed it in the interests of the Irish landlords, and of
economic principles in general, principles which (as commonly
understood in England) it certainly trenched on.<!-- Page 29 --><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29" />
When it reached the House of Lords it was contemptuously
rejected, and the unhappy Irish Secretary left to face as he
best might the cries of a wretched peasantry and the rising
tide of outrage. What was even more remarkable, was the
coolness with which the Liberal party took the defeat of a
Bill their leaders had pronounced absolutely needed. Had
it been an English Bill of the same consequence to England
as it was to Ireland, the country would have been up in
arms against the House of Lords, demanding the reform
or the abolition of a Chamber which dared to disregard the
will of the people. But nothing of the kind happened. It
was only an Irish measure. We relieved ourselves by a few
strong words, and the matter dropped.</p>

<p>It was in this session that the Liberal party first learnt
what sort of a spirit was burning in the hearts of Irish
members. There had been obstruction in the last years
of the previous Parliament, but, as the Tories were in
power, they had to bear the brunt of it. Now that a
Liberal Ministry reigned, it fell on the Liberals. At first
it incensed us. Full of our own good intentions towards
Ireland, we thought it contrary to nature that Irish members
should worry us, their friends, as they had worried Tories,
their hereditary enemies. Presently we came to understand
how matters stood. The Irish members made little
difference between the two great English parties. Both
represented to them a hostile domination. Both were
ignorant of the condition of their country. Both cared so
little about Irish questions that nothing less than deeds of
violence out of doors or obstruction within doors could
secure their attention. Concessions had to be extorted
from both by the same devices; Coercion might be feared
at the hands of both. Hence the Irish party was resolved
to treat both parties alike, and play off the one against the
other in the interests of Ireland alone, using the questions
which divide Englishmen and Scotchmen merely as levers
<!-- Page 30 --><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30" />whereby to effect their own purposes, because themselves
quite indifferent to the substantial merits of those questions.
To us new members this was an alarming revelation. We
found that the House of Commons consisted of two distinct
and dissimilar bodies: a large British body (including some
few Tories and Liberals from Ireland), which, though it was
distracted by party quarrels, really cared for the welfare
of the country and the dignity of the House, and would
set aside its quarrels in the presence of a great emergency;
and a small Irish body, which, though it spoke the English
language, was practically foreign, felt no interest in, no
responsibility for, the business of Britain or the Empire,
and valued its place in the House only as a means of
making itself so disagreeable as to obtain its release. When
we had grasped this fact, we began to reflect on its causes
and conjecture its effects. We had read of the same things
in the newspapers, but what a difference there is between
reading a drama in your study and seeing it acted on the
stage! We realized what Irish feeling was when we heard
these angry cries, and noted how appeals that would have
affected English partisans fell on deaf ears. I remember
how one night in the summer of 1880, when the Irish
members kept us up very late over some trivial Bill of
theirs, refusing to adjourn till they had extorted terms, a
friend, sitting beside me, said, &quot;See how things come
round. They keep us out of bed till five o'clock in the
morning because our ancestors bullied theirs for six
centuries.&quot; And we saw that the natural relations of an
Executive, even a Liberal Executive, to the Irish members
were those of strife. Whose fault it was we were unable to
decide. Perhaps the Government was too stiff; perhaps
the members were vexatious. Anyhow, this strife was
evidently the normal state of things, wholly unlike that
which existed between Scotch members, to whichever party
they belonged, and the executive authorities of Scotland.</p>

<p><!-- Page 31 --><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31" />Thus the session of 1880, though it did not bring us
consciously nearer to Home Rule, impressed three facts
upon us: first, that the House of Lords regarded Ireland
solely from the point of view of English landlords,
sympathizing with Irish landlords; secondly, that the
House of Commons knew so little or cared so little
about Ireland that when the Executive declared a measure
essential to the peace of Ireland, it scarcely resented the
rejection of that measure by the House of Lords; thirdly,
that the Irish Nationalists in the House of Commons were
a foreign body, foreign in the sense in which a needle which
a man swallows is foreign, not helping the organism to
discharge its functions, but impeding them, and setting up
irritation. We did not yet draw from these facts all the
conclusions we should now draw. But the facts were there,
and they began to tell upon our minds.</p>

<p>SESSION OF 1881.&mdash;The winter of 1880-81 was a terrible
one in Ireland. The rejection of the Compensation for
Disturbance Bill had borne the fruit which Mr. Forster
had predicted, and which the House of Lords had ignored.
Outrages were numerous and serious. The cry in England
for repressive measures had gone on rising from November,
when it occasioned a demonstration at the Guildhall banquet.
Several Liberal members (of whom I was one) went
to Ireland at Christmas, to see with our own eyes how
things stood. We were struck by the difficulty of obtaining
trustworthy information in Dublin, where the richer classes,
with whom we chiefly came in contact, merely abused the
Land League, while the Land Leaguers declared that the
accounts of outrages were grossly exaggerated. The most
prominent, Mr. Michael Davitt, assured me, and I believe
with perfect truth, that he had exerted himself to discountenance
outrage, and that if, as he expected, he was
locked up by the Government, outrages would increase.
When one reached the disturbed districts, where, of course,
<!-- Page 32 --><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32" />one talked to members as well of the landlord class as of
the peasantry, the general conclusion which emerged from
the medley of contradictions was that, though there was
much agrarian crime, and a pervading sense of insecurity,
the disorders were not so bad as people in England believed,
and might have been dealt with by a vigorous administration
of the existing law. Unfortunately, the so-called
&quot;better classes,&quot; full of bitterness against the Liberal
Ministry and Mr. Forster (whom they did not praise till
it was too late), had not assisted the Executive, and had
allowed things to reach a pass at which it found the work
of governing very difficult.</p>

<p>When the Coercion Bill of 1881 was introduced, many
English Liberals were inclined to resist it. The great
majority voted for it, but within two years they bitterly
repented their votes. Our motives, which I mention by
way of extenuation, not of defence, were these. The Executive
Government declared that it could not deal with crime
by the ordinary law. If its followers refused exceptional
powers, they must displace the Ministry, and let in the
Tories, who would doubtless obtain such powers, and probably
use them worse. We had still confidence in Mr.
Forster's judgment, and a deference to Irish Executive
Governments generally which Parliamentary experience is well
fitted to dissipate. The violence with which the Nationalist
members resisted the introduction of the Bill had roused
our blood, and the foolish attempts which the Radical and
Irish electors in some constituencies had made to deter
their members from supporting it had told the other way,
and disposed these members to vote for it, in order to show
that they were not to be cowed by threats. Finally, we were
assured that votes given for the Coercion Bill would purchase
a thorough-going Land Bill, and our anxiety for the latter
induced us, naturally, but erringly, to acquiesce in the former.</p>

<p>When that Land Bill went into Committee we perceived
<!-- Page 33 --><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33" />how much harm the Coercion Bill had done in intensifying
the bitterness of Irish members. Although the Ministry
was fighting for their interests against the Tory party and
the so-called Whiggish section of its own supporters, who
were seeking to cut down the benefits which the measure
offered to Irish tenants, the Nationalist members regarded
it, and in particular Mr. Forster, as their foe. They resented
what they deemed the insult put upon their country. They
saw those who had been fighting, often, no doubt, by
unlawful methods, for the national cause, thrown into
prison and kept there without trial. They anticipated
(not without reason) the same fortune for themselves.
Hence the friendliness which the Liberal party sought to
show them met with no response, and Mr. Forster was
worried with undiminished vehemence. In the discussions
on the Bill we found the Ministry generally resisting all
amendments which came from Irish members. When these
amendments seemed to us right, we voted for them, but
they were almost always defeated by the union of the Tories
with the steady Ministerialists. Subsequent events have
proved that many were right, but, whether they were right
or wrong, the fact which impressed us was that in matters
which concerned Ireland only, and lay within the exclusive
knowledge of Irishmen, Irish members were constantly
outvoted by English and Scotch members, who knew
nothing at all of the merits of the case, but simply obeyed
the party whip. This happened even when the Irish
members who sat on the Liberal side (such as Mr. Dickson
and his Liberal colleagues from Ulster) joined the Nationalist
section in demanding some extension of the Bill which
the Ministry refused. And we perceived that nothing
incensed the Irish members more than the feeling that their
arguments were addressed to deaf ears; that they were
overborne, not by reason, but by sheer weight of numbers.
Even if they convinced the Ministry, they could seldom
<!-- Page 34 --><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34" />hope to obtain its assent, because the Ministry had to
consider the House of Lords, sure to reject amendments
which favoured the tenant, while to detach a number of
Ministerialists sufficient to carry an amendment against the
Treasury Bench, the Moderate Liberals, and the Tories,
was evidently hopeless.</p>

<p>At the end of the session the House of Lords came
again upon the scene. It seriously damaged the Bill by its
amendments, and would have destroyed it but for the skill
with which the head of the Government handled these
amendments, accepting the least pernicious, so as to enable
the Upper House without loss of dignity to recede from
those which were wholly inadmissible. Several times it
seemed as if the conflict would have to pass from Westminster
to the country, and, in contemplating the chances
of a popular agitation or a dissolution, we were regretfully
obliged to own that the English people cared too little and
knew too little about Irish questions to give us much hope
of defeating the House of Lords and the Tories upon these
issues.</p>

<p>An incident which occurred towards the end of the
session seems, though trifling in itself, so illustrative of the
illogical position in which we stood towards Ireland, as to
deserve mention. Mr. Forster, still Chief Secretary, had
brought in a Bill for extinguishing the Queen's University
in Ireland, and creating in place of it a body to be called
the Royal University, which, however, was not to be a real
university at all, but only a set of examiners plus some
salaried fellowships, to be held at various places of instruction.
Regarding this as a gross educational blunder,
which would destroy a useful existing body, and create a
sham university in its place, and finding several Parliamentary
friends on whose judgment I could rely to be of the
same opinion, I gave notice of opposition to the Bill. Mr.
Forster came to me, and pressed with great warmth that
<!-- Page 35 --><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35" />the opposition should be withdrawn. The Bill, he said,
would satisfy the Roman Catholic hierarchy, and complete
the work of the Land Bill in pacifying Ireland. The Irish
members wanted it: what business had an English member
to interfere to defeat their wishes, and thwart the Executive?
The reply was obvious. Not to speak of the simplicity of
expecting the hierarchy to be satisfied by this small concession,
what were such arguments but the admission of Home
Rule in its worst form? &quot;You resist the demand of the
Irish members to legislate for Ireland; you have just been
demanding, and obtaining, the support of English members
against those amendments of the Land Bill which Irish
members declare to be necessary. Now you bid us surrender
our own judgment, ignore our own responsibility,
and blindly pass a Bill which we, who have studied these
university questions as they affect both Ireland and England,
believe to be thoroughly mischievous to the prospects of
higher education in Ireland, only because the Irish
members, as you say, desire it. Do one thing or the
other. Either give them the power and the responsibility,
or leave both with the Imperial Parliament. You are now
asking us to surrender the power, but to remain still subject
to the responsibility. We will not bear the latter without
the former. We shall prefer Home Rule.&quot; Needless to
add that this device&mdash;a sample of the petty sops by which
successive generations of English statesmen, Whigs and
Tories alike, have sought to win over a priesthood which
uses and laughs at them&mdash;failed as completely as its
predecessors to settle the University question or to range
the bishops on the side of the Government.</p>

<p>The autumn and winter of 1881 revealed the magnitude
of the mischief done by making a Coercion Bill precede a
Relief Bill. The Land Bill was the largest concession made
to the demands of the people since Catholic Emancipation.
It was a departure, justified by necessity, but still a de<!-- Page 36 --><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36" />parture
from our established principles of legislation. It
ought to have brought satisfaction and confidence, if not
gratitude, with it; ought to have led Ireland to believe in
the sincere friendliness of England, and produced a new
cordiality between the islands. It did nothing of the kind.
It was held to have been extorted from our fears; its grace
and sweetness were destroyed by the concomitant severities
which the Coercion Act had brought into force, as wholesome
food becomes distasteful when some bitter compound
has been sprinkled over it. We were deeply mortified at
this result of our efforts. What was the malign power which
made the boons we had conferred shrivel up, &quot;like fairy
gifts fading away&quot;? We still believed the Coercion Act to
have been justified, but lamented the fate which baffled the
main object of our efforts, the winning over Ireland to trust
the justice and the capacity of the Imperial Parliament. And
thus the two facts which stood out from the history of this
eventful session were, first, that even in legislating for the
good of Ireland we were legislating against the wishes of
Ireland, imposing on her enactments which her representatives
opposed, and which we supported only at the bidding
of the Ministry; and, secondly, that at the end of a long
session, entirely devoted to her needs, we found her more
hostile and not less disturbed than she had been at its
beginning. We began to wonder whether we should ever
succeed better on our present lines. But we still mostly
regarded Home Rule as a disagreeable solution.</p>

<p>SESSION OF 1882.&mdash;Still graver were the lessons of
the first four months of this year. Mr. Forster went on
filling the prisons of Ireland with persons whom he arrested
under the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act, and never
brought to trial. But the country grew no more quiet. At
last he had nine hundred and forty men under lock and
key, many of them not &quot;village ruffians,&quot; whose power a few
weeks' detention was to break, but political offenders, and
<!-- Page 37 --><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37" />even popular leaders. How long could this go on? Where
was it to stop? It became plain that the Act was a failure,
and that the people, trained to combination by a century
and a half's practice, were too strong for the Executive.
Either the scheme and plan of the Act had been wrong, or
its administration had been incompetent. Whichever was
the source of the failure (most people will now blame both),
the fault must be laid at the door of the Irish Executive;
not of Mr. Forster himself, but of those on whom he relied.
It had been a Dublin Castle Bill, conceived and carried out
by the incompetent bureaucracy which has so long pretended
to govern Ireland. Such a proof of incompetence destroyed
whatever confidence in that bureaucracy then remained to
us, and the disclosures which the Phoenix Park murders
and the subsequent proceedings against the Invincibles
brought out, proved beyond question that the Irish Executive
had only succeeded in giving a more dark and dangerous
form, the form of ruthless conspiracy, to the agitation it was
combating.</p>

<p>When therefore the Prevention of Crime Bill of 1882
was brought in, some of us felt unable to support it, and
specially bound to resist those of its provisions which related
to trials without a jury, and to boycotting. It was impossible,
on the morrow of the Phoenix Park murders, to deny
that some coercive measure might be needed; but we had
so far lost faith in repression, and in the officials who were
to administer it, as to desire to limit it to what was absolutely
necessary, and we protested against enacting for Ireland
a criminal code which was not to be applied to Great
Britain. Our resistance might have been more successful
but for the manner in which the Nationalist members conducted
their opposition. When they began to obstruct&mdash;not
that under the circumstances we felt entitled to censure
them for obstructing a Bill dealing so harshly with their
countrymen&mdash;we were obliged to desist, and our experience
<!-- Page 38 --><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38" />of the stormy scenes of the summer of 1882 deepened our
sense of the passionate bitterness with which they regarded
English members, scarcely making an exception in favour of
those who were most disposed to sympathize with them.
Many and many a time when we listened to their fierce
cries, we seemed to hear in them the battle-cries of the
centuries of strife between Celt and Englishman from
Athenry to Vinegar Hill; many a time we felt that this rage
and mistrust were chiefly of England's making; and yet not
of England's, but rather of the overmastering fate which had
prolonged to our own days the hatreds and the methods of
barbarous times:</p>

</p>

<p>So much of the session as the Crime Bill had spared
was consumed by the Arrears Bill, over which we had again
a &quot;crisis&quot; with the House of Lords. This was the third
session that had been practically given up to Irishmen.
The freshness and force of the Parliament of 1880&mdash;a Parliament
full of zeal and ability&mdash;had now been almost spent,
yet few of the plans of domestic legislation spread before the
constituencies of 1880 had been realized. The Government
had been anxious to legislate, their majority had been ready
to support them, but Ireland had blocked the way; and
now the only expedient for improving the procedure of the
House was to summon Parliament in an extra autumn
session. Here was another cause for reflection. England
and Scotland were calling for measures promised years ago,
but no time could be found to discuss them. Nothing was
done to reorganize local government, to reform the liquor
laws, to improve secondary education, to deal with the
housing of the poor, or a dozen other urgent questions,
because we were busy with Ireland; and yet how little more
loyal or contented did Ireland seem to be for all we had
<!-- Page 39 --><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39" />done. We began to ask whether Home Rule might not be
as much an English and Scotch question as an Irish question.
It was, at any rate, clear that to allow Ireland to
manage her own affairs would open a prospect for England
and Scotland to obtain time to attend to theirs.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3" /><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>This feeling was strengthened by the result of the
attempts made in the autumn session of 1882, to improve
the procedure of the House of Commons. We had cherished
the hope that more drastic remedies against obstruction and
better arrangements for the conduct of business, might
relieve much of the pressure Irish members had made us
suffer. The passing of the New Rules shattered this hope,
for it was plain they would not accomplish what was needed.
Some blamed the Government for not framing a more
stringent code. Some blamed the Tory and the Irish Oppositions
(now beginning to work in concert) for cutting
down the proposals of the Government. But most of us
saw, and came to see still more clearly in the three succeeding
sessions, that the evil was too deep-rooted to be cured
by any changes of procedure, unless they went so far as to
destroy freedom of debate for English members also. The
presence in a deliberative assembly of a section numbering
(or likely soon to number) one-seventh of the whole&mdash;a
section seeking to lower the character of the assembly, and
to derange its mechanism, with no further interest in the
greater part of its business except that of preventing it from
<!-- Page 40 --><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40" />conducting that business&mdash;this was the phenomenon which
confronted us, and we felt that no rules of debate would
overcome the dangers it threatened.</p>

<p>It is from this year 1882 that I date the impression
which we formed, that Home Rule was sure to come. &quot;It
may be a bold experiment,&quot; we said to one another in the
lobbies; &quot;there are serious difficulties in the way, though
the case for it is stronger than we thought two years ago.
But if the Irishmen persist as they are doing now, they will
get it. It is only a question of their tenacity.&quot;</p>

<p>It was impossible not to be struck during the conflicts
of 1881 and 1882 with the small amount of real bitterness
which the conduct of the Irish members, irritating as it often
was, provoked among the Liberals, who of course bore the
brunt of the conflict. The Nationalists did their best to
injure a Government which was at the same time being
denounced by the Tories as too favourable to Irish claims;
they lowered the character of Parliament by scenes far more
painful than those of the session of 1887, on which so much
indignation has been lately expended; they said the hardest
things they could think of against us in the House; they
attacked us in our constituencies. Their partisans (for I do
not charge this on the leaders) interrupted and broke up
our meetings. Nevertheless, all this did not provoke
responsive hatred from the Liberals. There could not be
a greater contrast than that between the way in which the
great bulk of the Liberal members all through the Parliament
of 1880 behaved towards their Irish antagonists, and
the violence with which the Tory members, under much
slighter provocation, conduct themselves towards those
antagonists now. I say this not to the credit of our temper,
which was no better than that of other men heated by the
struggles of a crowded assembly. It was due entirely to
our feeling that there was a great balance of wrong standing
to the debit of England; that if the Irish were turbulent, it
<!-- Page 41 --><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41" />was the ill-treatment of former days that had made them so;
and that, whatever might be their methods, they were fighting
for their country. Although, therefore, there was little
social intercourse between us and them, there was always
a hope and a wish that the day might come when the
Liberal party should resume its natural position of joining
the representatives of the Irish people in obtaining radical
reforms in Irish government. And the remarkable speech of
February 9, 1882, in which Mr. Gladstone declared his mind
to be open on the subject, and invited the Nationalists
to propound a practicable scheme of self-government, had
encouraged us to hope that this day might soon arrive.</p>

<p>SESSION OF 1883.&mdash;Three facts stood out in the history
of this comparatively quiet session, each of which brought us
further along the road we had entered.</p>

<p>One was the omission of Parliament to complete the
work begun by the Land Bill of 1881, of improving the
condition of the Irish peasantry and reorganizing Irish administration.
The Nationalist members brought in Bills
for these purposes, including one for amending the Land
Act by admitting leaseholders to its benefits and securing
tenants against having their improvements reckoned against
them in the fixing of rents. Though we could not approve
all the contents of these Bills, we desired to see the Government
either take them up and amend them, or introduce
Bills of its own to do what was needed. Some of us
spoke strongly in this sense, nor will any one now deny
that we were right. Sound policy called aloud for the
completion of the undertaking of 1881. The Government
however refused, alleging, no doubt with some truth, that
Ireland could not have all the time of Parliament, but must
let England and Scotland have their turn. Nor was anything
done towards the creation of new local institutions in
Ireland, or the reform of the Castle bureaucracy. We were
profoundly disheartened. We saw golden opportunities
<!-- Page 42 --><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42" />slipping away, and doubted more than ever whether
Westminster was the place in which to legislate for Irish
grievances.</p>

<p>Another momentous fact was the steady increase in the
number of Nationalist members. Every seat that fell vacant
in Ireland was filled by them. The moderate Irish party,
most of whom had by this time crossed the floor of
the House, and were sitting among us, had evidently no
future. They were estimable, and, in some cases, able men,
from whom we had hoped much, as a link between the
Liberal party and the Irish people. But they seemed to
have lost their hold on the people, nor were they able to
give us much practical counsel as to Irish problems. It was
clear that they would vanish at the next General Election,
and Parliament be left to settle accounts with the extreme
men, whose spirits rose as those of our friends steadily sank.</p>

<p>Lastly: it was in this session that the alliance of the
Nationalists and the Tory Opposition became a potent
factor in politics. Its first conspicuous manifestation was
in the defeat of the Government by the allied forces on
the Affirmation Bill, when the least respectable privates in
both armies vied with one another in boisterous rejoicings
over the announcement of numbers in the division. I do
not refer to this as ground for complaint. It was in the
course of our usual political warfare that two groups, each
hating and fearing the Ministry, should unite to displace it.
But we now saw what power the Irish section must exert
when it came to hold the balance of numbers in the House.
Till this division, the Government had commanded a
majority of the whole House. This would probably not
outlast a dissolution. What then? Could the two English
parties, differing so profoundly from one another, combine
against the third party? Evidently not. We must, therefore,
look forward to unstable Governments, if not to a total
dislocation of our Parliamentary system.</p>

<p><!-- Page 43 --><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43" />Session of 1884.&mdash;I pass over the minor incidents of
this year, including the continued neglect of remedial legislation
for Ireland to dwell on its dominant and most impressive
lesson. It was the year of the Franchise Bill, which,
as regards Ireland, worked an extension, not merely of the
county but also of the borough franchise, and produced,
owing to the economic condition of the humbler classes in
that country, a far more extensive change than in England
or Scotland. When the Bill was introduced the question
at once arose&mdash;Should Ireland be included?</p>

<p>There were two ways of treating Ireland between which
Parliament had to choose.</p>

<p>One was to leave her out of the Bill, on the ground that
the masses of her population could not be trusted with the
franchise, as being ignorant, sympathetic to crime, hostile
to the English Government. This course was the logical
concomitant of exceptional coercive legislation, such as had
been passed in 1881 and 1882. It was quite compatible
with generous remedial legislation. But it placed Ireland in
an unequal and lower position, treating her, as the Coercion
Acts did, as a dependent country, inhabited by a population
unfit for the same measure of power which the inhabitants
of Britain might receive.</p>

<p>The other course was to bestow on Ireland the same
extended franchise which the English county occupiers were
to receive, applying the principle of equality, and disregarding
the obvious consequences. These consequences were
both practical and logical. The practical consequence was
the increase in numbers and weight of the Irish party in
Parliament hostile to Parliament itself. The logical consequence
was the duty of complying with the wishes of the
enfranchised nation. Whatever reasons were good for
giving this enlarged suffrage to the Irish masses, were good
for respecting the will which they might use to express it.
If the Irish were deemed fit to exercise the same full
<!-- Page 44 --><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44" />constitutional rights in legislation as the English, must they
not be fit for the same rights of trial by jury, a free press,
and all the privileges of personal freedom?</p>

<p>Of these two courses the Cabinet chose the latter,
those of its members whom we must suppose, from the
language they now hold, to have then hesitated, either
stifling their fears or not apprehending the consequences
of their boldness. It might have been expected, and
indeed was generally expected, that the Tory party would
refuse to follow. They talked largely about the danger
of an extended Irish suffrage, and pointed out that it
would be a weapon in the hands of disloyalty. But when
the moment for resistance came, they swerved, and never
divided in either House against the application of the Bill
to Ireland. They might have failed to defeat the measure;
but they would have immensely strengthened their position,
logically and morally, had they given effect by their votes to
the sentiments they were known to entertain, and which not
a few Liberals shared.</p>

<p>The effect of this uncontested grant to Ireland of a
suffrage practically universal was immense upon our minds,
and the longer we reflected on it the more significant did
it become. It meant to us that the old methods were
abandoned, and, as we supposed, for ever. We had
deliberately given the Home Rule party arms against English
control far more powerful than they previously possessed.
We had deliberately asserted our faith in the Irish people.
Impossible after this to fall back on Coercion Bills. Impossible
to refuse any request compatible with the general
safety of the United Kingdom, which Ireland as a nation
might prefer. Impossible to establish that system of Crown
Colony Government which we had come to perceive was
the only real and solid alternative to self-government. To
those of us who had been feeling that the Irish difficulty
was much the greatest of all England's difficulties, this stood
<!-- Page 45 --><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45" />out beyond the agitation of the autumn and the compromise
of the winter as the great political event of 1884.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4" /><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Although this sketch is in the main a record of Parliamentary
opinion, I ought not to pass over the influence
which the study of their constituents' ideas exerted upon
members for the larger towns. We found the vast bulk of
our supporters&mdash;English supporters, for after 1882 it was
understood that the Irish voters were our enemies&mdash;sympathetic
with the Irish people. They knew and thought little
about Home Rule, believing that their member understood
that question better than they did, and willing, so long as
he was sound on English issues, to trust him. But they
pitied Irish tenants, and condemned Irish landlords.
Though they acquiesced in a Coercion Bill when proposed
by a Liberal Cabinet, because they concluded that nothing
less than necessity would lead such a Cabinet to propose
one, they so much disliked any exceptional or repressive
legislation that it was plain they would not long tolerate it.
Any popular leader denouncing coercion was certain to have
the sentiment of the English masses with him, while as to
suspending Irish representation or carrying out consistently
the policy of treating Ireland as a subject country, there
was no chance in the world of their approval. Those of us,
therefore, who represented large working-class constituencies
became convinced that the solution of the Irish problem
must be sought in conciliation and self-government, if only
because the other solution, Crown Colony Government, was
utterly repugnant to the English masses, in whom the
<!-- Page 46 --><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46" />Franchise Bill of 1884, completing that of 1867, had vested
political supremacy.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5" /><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Session of 1885.&mdash;The allied powers of Toryism and
Nationalism gained in this year the victory they had so long
striven for. In February they reduced the Ministerial
majority to fourteen; in June they overthrew the Ministry.
No one supposed that on either occasion the merits of the
issue had anything to do with the Nationalist vote: that
vote was given simply and solely against the Government,
as the Government which had passed the Coercion Acts of
1881 and 1882&mdash;Acts demanded by the Tory party, and
which had not conceded an Irish Parliament. At last the
Irish party had attained its position as the arbiter of power
and office. Some of us said, as we walked away from the
House, under the dawning light of that memorable 9th of
June, &quot;This means Home Rule.&quot; Our forecast was soon
to be confirmed. Lord Salisbury's Cabinet, formed upon
the resignation of Mr. Gladstone's, announced that it would
not propose to renew any part of the Coercion Act of 1882,
which was to expire in August. Here was a surrender
indeed! But the Tory leaders went further. They did not
excuse themselves on the ground of want of time. They
took credit for their benevolence towards Ireland; they discovered
excellent reasons why the Act should be dropped.
They even turned upon Lord Spencer, whose administration
they had hitherto blamed for its leniency, and attacked him
in Parliament, among the cheers of his Irish enemies. From
that time till the close of the General Election in December
everything was done, short of giving public pledges, to keep
the Irish leaders and the Irish voters in good humour. The
Tory party in fact posed as the true friends of Ireland, averse
<!-- Page 47 --><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47" />from coercion, and with minds perfectly open on the subject
of self-government.</p>

<p>This change of front, so sudden, so unblushing, completed
the process which had been going on in our minds.
By 1882 we had come to feel that Home Rule was inevitable,
though probably undesirable. Before long we had asked
ourselves whether it was really undesirable, whether it might
not be a good thing both for England, whose Parliament
and Cabinet system it would relieve from impending dangers,
while leaving free scope for domestic legislation, and for
Ireland, which could hardly manage her affairs worse than
we were managing them for her, and might manage them
better. And thus, by the spring of 1885, many of us were
prepared for a large scheme of local self-government in
Ireland, including a central legislative body in Dublin.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6" /><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Now when it was plain that the English party which had
hitherto called for repression, and had professed itself anxious
for a patriotic union of all parties to maintain order and a
continuity of policy in Ireland, was ready to bid for Irish
help at the polls by throwing over repression and reversing
the policy it had advocated, we felt that the sooner Ireland
was taken out of English party politics the better. What
prospect was there of improving Ireland by the superior
wisdom and fairness of the British Parliament, if British
leaders were to make their Irish policy turn on interested
bargains with Nationalist leaders? Repression, which we
<!-- Page 48 --><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48" />clearly saw to be the only alternative to self-government,
seemed to be by common consent abandoned. I remember
how, at a party of members in the beginning of July, some
one said, &quot;Well, there's an end for ever of coercion at any
rate,&quot; and every one assented as to an obvious truth. Accordingly
the result of the new departure of the Salisbury
Cabinet in 1885 was to convince even doubters that Home
Rule must come, and to make those already convinced
anxious to see it come quickly, and to find the best form
that could be given it. Many of us expected the Tory
Government to propose it. Rumour declared the new Lord
Lieutenant to be in favour of it. His government was extremely
conciliatory in Ireland, even to the recalcitrant corporation
of Limerick. Not to mention less serious and less
respected Tory Ministers, Lord Salisbury talked at Newport
about the dualism of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy with
the air of a man who desired to have a workable scheme,
analogous, if not similar, suggested for Ireland and Great
Britain. The Irish Nationalists appeared to place their
hopes in this quarter, for they attacked the Liberal party
with unexampled bitterness, and threw all their voting
strength into the Tory scale.</p>

<p>As it has lately been attempted to blacken the character
of the Irish leaders, it deserves to be remarked that whatever
has been charged against them was said or done by them
before the spring of 1885, and was, practically, perfectly well
known to the Tory leaders when they accepted the alliance
of the Irish party in the House of Commons, and courted
their support in the election of 1885. To those who
remember what went on in the House in the sessions of
1884 and 1885, the horror now professed by the Tory
leaders for the conduct and words of the Irish party would
be matter for laughter if it were not also matter for just
indignation.</p>

<p>Why, it may be asked, if the persuasion that Home Rule
<!-- Page 49 --><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49" />was certain, and even desirable, had become general among
the Liberals who had sat through the Parliament of 1880,
was it not more fully expressed at the election of 1885?
This is a fair question, which I shall try to answer.</p>

<p>In the first place, the electors made few inquiries about
Ireland. They disliked the subject; they had not realized
its supreme importance. Those of us who felt anxious to
explain our views (as was my own case) had to volunteer to
do so, for we were not asked about them. The Irish party
in the constituencies was in violent opposition to Liberal
candidates; it did not interrogate, but denounced. Further,
it was felt that the issue was mainly one to be decided in
Ireland itself. The question of Home Rule was being submitted,
not, as heretofore, to a limited constituency, but to
the whole Irish people. Till their will had been constitutionally
declared at the polls it was not proper that Englishmen
or Scotchmen should anticipate its tenour. We should
even have been accused, had we volunteered our opinions,
of seeking to affect the result in Ireland, and, not only of
playing for the Irish vote in Great Britain, as we saw the
Tories doing, but of prejudicing the chances of those Liberal
candidates who, in Irish constituencies, were competing with
extreme Nationalists. A third reason was that most English
and Scotch Liberals did not know how far their own dispositions
towards Home Rule were shared by their leaders.
Mr. Gladstone's declaration in his Midlothian address was
no doubt a decided intimation of his views, and was certainly
understood by some (as by myself) to imply the grant to
Ireland of a Parliament; but, strong as its words were, its
importance does not seem to have been fully appreciated at
the moment. And the opinions of a statesman whose unequalled
Irish experience and elevated character gave him a
weight only second to that of Mr. Gladstone&mdash;I mean Lord
Spencer&mdash;had not been made known. We had consequently
no certainty that there were leaders prepared to give
<!-- Page 50 --><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50" />prompt effect to the views we entertained. Lastly, we were
not prepared with a practical scheme of self-government for
Ireland. The Nationalist members had propounded none
which we could either adopt or criticize. Convinced as we
were that Home Rule would come and must come, we felt
the difficulties surrounding every suggestion that had yet
been made, and had not hammered out any plan which we
could lay before the electors as approved by Liberal opinion.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7" /><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
We were forced to confine ourselves to generalities.</p>

<p>Whether it would have been better for us to have done
our thinking and scheme-making in public, and thereby have
sooner forced the details of the problem upon the attention
of the country, need not now be inquired. Any one can
now see that something was lost by the omission. But
those who censure a course that has actually been taken
usually fail to estimate the evils that would have followed
from the taking of the opposite course. Such evils might
in this instance have been as great as those we have
encountered.</p>

<p>I have spoken of the importance we attached to the
decision of Ireland itself, and of the attitude of expectancy
which, while that decision was uncertain, Englishmen were
forced to maintain. We had not long to wait. Early in
December it was known that five-sixths of the members
returned from Ireland were Nationalists, and that the
<!-- Page 51 --><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51" />majorities which had returned them were crushing. If ever
a people spoke its will, the Irish people spoke theirs at the
election of 1885. The last link in the chain of conviction,
which events had been forging since 1880, was now supplied.
In passing the Franchise Bill of 1884, we had asked Ireland
to declare her mind. She had now answered. If the
question was not a mockery, and representative government
a sham, we were bound to accept the answer, subject only,
but subject always, to the interests of the whole United
Kingdom. In other words, we were bound to devise such
a scheme of self-government for Ireland as would give full
satisfaction to her wishes, while maintaining the ultimate
supremacy of the Imperial Parliament and the unity of the
British Empire.</p>

<p>Very few words are needed to summarize the outline
which, omitting many details which would have illustrated
and confirmed its truth, I have attempted to present of the
progress of opinion among Liberal members of the Parliament
of 1880.</p>

<p>1. Our experience of the Coercion Bills of 1881 and
1882 disclosed the enormous mischief which such measures
do in alienating the minds of Irishmen, and the difficulty of
enlisting Irish sentiment on behalf of the law. The results
of the Act of 1881 taught us that the repression of open
agitation means the growth of far more dangerous conspiracy;
those of the Act of 1882 proved that even under
an administration like Lord Spencer's repression works no
change for the better in the habits and ideas of the people.</p>

<p>2. The conduct of the House of Lords in 1880 and
1881, and the malign influence which its existence exerted
whenever remedial legislation for Ireland came in question,
convinced us that full and complete justice will never be done
to Ireland by the British Parliament while the Upper House
(as at present constituted) remains a part of that Parliament.</p>

<p>3. The break-down of the procedure of the House of<!-- Page 52 --><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52" />
Commons, and the failure of the efforts to amend it, proved
that Parliament cannot work so long as a considerable
section of its members seek to impede its working. To
enable it to do its duty by England and Scotland, it was
evidently necessary, either to make the Irish members as
loyal to Parliament as English and Scotch members usually
are, or else to exclude them.</p>

<p>4. The discussions of Irish Bills in the House of
Commons made us realize how little English members knew
about Ireland; how utterly different were their competence
for, and their attitude towards, Irish questions and English
questions. We perceived that we were legislating in the
dark for a country whose economic and social condition
we did not understand&mdash;a country to which we could not
apply our English ideas of policy; a country whose very
temper and feeling were strange to us. We were really
fitter to pass laws for Canada or Australia than for this isle
within sight of our shores.</p>

<p>5. I have said that we were legislating in the dark. But
there were two quarters from which light was proffered, the
Irish members and the Irish Executive. We rejected the first,
and could hardly help doing so, for to accept it would have
been to displace our own leaders. We followed the light
which the Executive gave. But in some cases (as notably
in the case of the Coercion Bill of 1881) it proved to be a
&quot;wandering fire,&quot; leading us into dangerous morasses. And
we perceived that at all times legislation at the bidding of
the Executive, against the wishes of Irish members, was not
self-government or free government. It was despotism.
The rule of Ireland by the British Parliament was really
&quot;the rule of a dependency through an official, responsible
no doubt, but responsible not to the ruled, but to an
assembly of which they form less than a sixth part.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8" /><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> As
<!-- Page 53 --><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53" />this assembly closed its ears to the one-sixth, and gave effect
to the will of the official, this was essentially arbitrary
government, and wanted those elements of success which
free government contains.</p>

<p>This experience had, by 1884, convinced us that the
present relations of the British Parliament to Ireland were
bad, and could not last; that the discontent of Ireland was
justified; that the existing system, in alienating the mind of
Ireland, tended, not merely to Repeal, but to Separation;
that the simplest, and probably the only effective, remedy
for the increasing dangers was the grant of an Irish Legislature.
Two events clinched these conclusions. One was
the Tory surrender of June, 1885. Self-government, we had
come to see, was the only alternative to Coercion, and now
Coercion was gone. The other was the General Election
of December, 1885, when newly-enfranchised Ireland,
through five-sixths of her representatives, demanded a
Parliament of her own.</p>

<p>These were not, as is sometimes alleged, conclusions of
despair. We were mostly persons of a cautious and conservative
turn of mind, as men imbued with the spirit of the
British Constitution ought to be. The first thing was to
convince us that the existing relations of the islands were
faulty, and could not be maintained. This was a negative
result, and while we remained in that stage we were despondent.
Many Liberal members will remember the gloom
that fell on us in 1882 and 1883 whenever we thought or
spoke of Ireland. But presently the clouds lifted. We still
felt the old objections to any Home Rule scheme, though
we now saw that they were less formidable than the evils of
the present system. But we came to feel that the grant of
self-government was a right thing in itself. It was not
merely a means of ridding ourselves of our difficulties, not
merely a boon yielded because long demanded. It was a
return to broad and deep principles, a conformity to those
<!-- Page 54 --><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54" />natural laws which govern human society as well as the
inanimate world&mdash;an effort to enlist the better and higher
feelings of mankind in the creation of a truer union between
the two nations than had ever yet existed. When we
perceived this, hope returned. It is strong with us now,
for, though we see troubles, perhaps even dangers, in the
immediate future, we are confident that the principles on
which Liberal policy towards Ireland is based will in the
long run work out a happy issue for her, as they have in and
for every other country that has trusted to them.</p>

<p>One last word as to Consistency. We learnt in the
Parliament of 1880 many facts about Ireland we had not
known before; we felt the force and bearing of other facts
previously accepted on hearsay, but not realized. We saw
the Irish problem change from what it had been in 1880
into the new phase which stood apparent at the end of
1885, Coercion abandoned by its former advocates, Self-government
demanded by the nation. Were we to disregard
all these new facts, ignore all these new conditions,
and cling to old ideas, some of which we perceived to be
mistaken, while others, still true in themselves, were out-weighed
by arguments of far wider import? We did not so
estimate our duty. We foresaw the taunts of foes and the
reproaches of friends. But we resolved to give effect to the
opinions we slowly, painfully, even reluctantly formed,
opinions all the stronger because not suddenly adopted,
and founded upon evidence whose strength no one can
appreciate till he has studied the causes of Irish discontent
in Irish history, and been forced (as we were) to face in
Parliament the practical difficulties of the government of
Ireland by the British House of Commons.<!-- Page 55 --><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55" /></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3" /><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> I may mention here another fact whose significance impressed
some among us. Parliament, which usually sinned in not doing for
Ireland what Ireland asked, occasionally passed bills for Ireland which
were regarded as setting very bad precedents for England. By some
bargain between the Irish Office and the Nationalist members, measures
were put through which may have been right as respects Ireland, but
which embodied principles mischievous as respects Great Britain. We
felt that if it was necessary to enact such statutes, it would be better
that they should proceed from an Irish Legislature rather than from the
Imperial Parliament, which might be embarrassed by its own acts when
asked to extend the same principles to England. The Labourers' Act
of July, 1885, is the most conspicuous example.</p></div>

Belfast, told them that Home Rule was certainly coming, and urged
them to prepare some plan under which any special interests they
conceived the Protestant part of Ulster to have, would be effectually
safe-guarded. They were startled, and at first discomposed, but
presently told me I was mistaken; to which I could only reply that
time would show, and perhaps sooner then even English Liberals expected.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5" /><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> My recollection of a conversation with a distinguished public man
in July, 1882, enables me to say that this fact had impressed itself upon
us as early as that year. He doubted the fact, but admitted that, if
true, it was momentous. The passing of the Franchise Bill made it, in
our view, more momentous than ever.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6" /><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> Some thought that its functions should be very limited, while large
powers were granted to county boards or provincial councils. But most
had, I think, already perceived that the grant of a merely local self-government,
while retaining an irresponsible central bureaucracy, would
do more harm than good. It seemed at first sight a safer experiment
than the creation of a central legislative body. But, like many middle
courses, it combined the demerits and wanted the merits of each of the
extreme courses. It would not make the country tranquil, as firm and
long-continued repression might possibly do. Neither would it satisfy
the people's demands, and divert them from struggles against England
to disputes and discussions among themselves, as the gift of genuine
self-government might do.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7" /><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Some of us had tried to do so. I prepared such a scheme in the
autumn of 1885, and submitted it to some specially competent friends.
Their objections, made from what would now be called the Unionist
point of view, were weighty. But their effect was to convince me that
the scheme erred on the side of caution; and I believe the experience
of other Liberals who worked at the problem to have been the same as
my own&mdash;viz. that a small and timid scheme is more dangerous than a
large and bold one. Thus the result of our thinking from July, 1885, till
April, 1886, was to make us more and more disposed to reject half-and-half
solutions. Some of us (of whom I was one) expressed this feeling
by saying in our election addresses in 1885, &quot;the further we go in giving
the Irish people the management of their own affairs (subject to the
maintenance of the unity of the empire) the better.&quot;</p></div>

<h2><a name="HOME_RULE_AND_IMPERIAL_UNITY" id="HOME_RULE_AND_IMPERIAL_UNITY" />HOME RULE AND IMPERIAL UNITY</h2>

<p class="author">BY LORD THRING</p>


<p>The principal charge made against the scheme of Home
Rule contained in the Irish Government Bill, 1886, is that it
is incompatible with the maintenance of the unity of the
Empire and the supremacy of the Imperial Parliament.
A further allegation states that the Bill is useless, as agrarian
exasperation lies at the root of Irish discontent and Irish
disloyalty, and that no place would be found for a Home
Rule Bill even in Irish aspirations if an effective Land Bill
were first passed. An endeavour will be made in the following
pages to secure a verdict of acquittal on both counts&mdash;as
to the charge relating to Imperial unity and the supremacy
of the Imperial Parliament, by proving that the accusation
is absolutely unfounded, and based partly on a
misconception of the nature of Imperial ties, and partly on
a misapprehension of the effect of the provisions of the
Home Rule Bill as bearing on Imperial questions; and
as to the inutility of the Home Rule Bill in view of the
necessity of Land Reform, by showing that without a Home
Rule Bill no Land Bill worth consideration as a means of
pacifying Ireland can be passed.</p>

<p>The complete partisan spirit in which Home Rule has
been treated is the more to be deplored as the subject is
<!-- Page 56 --><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56" />one which does not lend itself readily to the trivialities
of party debates. It raises questions of principle, not of
detail. It ascends at once into the highest region of
politics. It is conversant with the great questions of constitutional
and international law, and leads to an inquiry
into the very nature of governments and the various modes
in which communities of men are associated together either
as simple or composite nations. To describe those modes in
detail would be to give a history of the various despotic,
monarchical, oligarchical, and democratic systems of government
which have oppressed or made happy the children of
men. Such a description is calculated to perplex and
mislead from its very extent; not so an inquiry into the
powers of government, and a classification of those powers.
They are limited in extent, and, if we confine ourselves to
English names and English necessities, we shall readily
attain to an apprehension of the mode in which empires,
nations, and political societies are bound together, at least
in so far as such knowledge is required for the understanding
of the nature of Imperial supremacy, and the mode in
which Home Rule in Ireland is calculated to affect that
supremacy.</p>

<p>The powers of government are divisible into two great
classes&mdash;1. Imperial powers; 2. State powers, using &quot;State&quot;
in the American sense of a political community subordinated
to some other power, and not in the sense of an
independent nation. The Imperial powers are in English
law described as the prerogatives of the Crown, and consist
in the main of the powers of making peace and war, of
maintaining armies and fleets and regulating commerce, and
making treaties with foreign nations. State powers are
complete powers of local self-government, described in our
colonial Constitutions as powers to make laws &quot;for the
peace, order, and good government of the Colony or State&quot;
in which such powers are to be exercised.</p>

<p><!-- Page 57 --><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57" />Intermediate between the Imperial and State powers are
a class of powers required to prevent disputes and facilitate
intercourse between the various parts of an empire or other
composite system of States&mdash;for example, the coinage of
money, and other regulations relating to the currency; the
laws relating to copyright, or other exclusive rights to the
use and profits of any works or inventions; and so forth.
These powers may be described as quasi-Imperial powers.</p>

<p>Having arrived at a competent knowledge of the materials
out of which governments are formed, it may be well
to proceed to a consideration of the manner in which those
materials have been worked up in building the two great
Anglo-Saxon composite nations&mdash;namely, the American
Union and the British Empire&mdash;for, if we find that the
arrangements proposed by the Irish Home Rule Bill are
strictly in accordance with the principles on which the unity
of the American Union was based and on which the Imperial
power of Great Britain has rested for centuries, the conclusion
must be that the Irish Home Rule Bill is not antagonistic
to the unity of the Empire or to the supremacy of the
British Parliament.</p>

<p>In discussing these matters it will be convenient to begin
with the American Union, as it is less extensive in area and
more homogeneous in its construction than the British
Empire. The thirteen revolted American colonies, on the
conclusion of their war with England, found themselves in
the position of thirteen independent States having no connection
with each other. The common tie of supremacy
exercised by the mother country was broken, and each
State was an independent nation, possessed both of Imperial
and Local rights.</p>

<p>The impossibility of a cluster of thirteen small independent
nations maintaining their independence against foreign
aggression became immediately apparent, and, to remedy
this evil, the thirteen States appointed delegates to form
<!-- Page 58 --><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58" />a convention authorized to weld them into one body as
respected Imperial powers. This was attempted to be
done by the establishment of a central body called a
Congress, consisting of delegates from the component States,
and invested with all the powers designated above as Imperial
and quasi-Imperial powers. The expenses incurred by
the confederacy were to be defrayed out of a common fund,
to be supplied by requisitions made on the several States.
In effect, the confederacy of the thirteen States amounted to
little more than an offensive and defensive alliance between
thirteen independent nations, as the central power had States
for its subjects and not individuals, and could only enforce the
law against any disobedient State by calling on the twelve other
States to make war on the refractory member of the union.
A system dependent for its efficacy on the concurrence of
so many separate communities contained in itself the seeds
of dissolution, and it soon became apparent that one of two
things must occur&mdash;either the American States must cease
as such to be a nation, or the component members of that
union must each be prepared to relinquish a further portion
of the sovereign or quasi-sovereign powers which it possessed.
Under those circumstances, what was the course taken by
the thirteen States? They perceived that it was quite
possible to maintain complete unity and compactness as
a nation if, in addition to investing the Supreme Government
with Imperial and quasi-Imperial powers, they added
full power to impose federal taxes on the component States
and established an Executive furnished with ample means
to carry all federal powers into effect through the medium
of federal officers. The government so formed consisted of
a President and two elected Houses called Congress, and,
as a balance-wheel of the Constitution, a Supreme Court
was established, to which was confided the task of deciding
in case of dispute all questions arising under the Constitution
of the United States or relating to international law.<!-- Page 59 --><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59" />
The Executive of the United States, with the President as
its source and head, was furnished with full authority and
power to enforce the federal laws. The army and navy
were under its command, and it was provided with courts of
justice, and subordinate officers to enforce the decrees of
those courts throughout the length and breadth of the
Union. Above all, a complete system of federal taxation
supplied the Central Government with the necessary funds
to perform effectually all the functions of a supreme national
government.</p>

<p>The nature of the Constitution of the United States will
be best understood by considering the position in which its
subjects stand to the Central Government and their own
State Governments. In effect, every inhabitant of the
United States has a double nationality. He belongs to one
great nation called the United States, or, as it would be
more aptly called to show its absolute unity, the American
Republic, having jurisdiction over the whole surface of
ground comprised in the area of the United States. He is
also a citizen of a smaller local and partially self-governing
body&mdash;more important than a county, but not approaching
the position of a nation&mdash;called a State.</p>

<p>It is no part of the object of this article to enter into
the details of the American government, its advantages or
defects. This much, however, is clear&mdash;the American Constitution
has lasted nearly one hundred years, and shows no
signs of decay or disruption. It has stood the strain of the
greatest war of modern times, and has emerged from the
conflict stronger than before. Even during the war the antagonism
of the rebels was directed, not against the Union,
but against the efforts of the Northern States to suppress
slavery, or, in other words, to destroy, as the Southern States
believed (not unjustly as the event showed), their property
in slaves, and consequently the only means they had of
making their estates profitable. One conclusion, then, we
<!-- Page 60 --><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60" />may draw, that a nation in which the Imperial powers and
the State powers are vested in different authorities is no less
compact and powerful, as respects all national capacities,
than a nation in which both classes of powers are wielded
by the same functionaries; and one lesson more may be
learnt from the American War of Secession&mdash;namely, that
in a nation having such a division of powers, any conflict
between the two classes results in the Supreme or Imperial
powers prevailing over the Local governmental powers, and
not in the latter invading or driving a wedge into the
Supreme powers. In fact, the tendency in case of a struggle
is towards an undue centralization of the nation by reason
of the encroachment by the Supreme authority, rather than
towards a weakening of the national unity by separatist
action on the part of the constituent members of the nation.</p>

<p>In comparing the Constitution of the United States with
the Constitution of the British Empire, we find an apparent
resemblance in form as respects the Anglo-Saxon colonies,
but underlying the surface a total difference of principle.
The United States is an aggregate of homogeneous and
contiguous States which, in order to weld themselves into a
nation, gave up a portion of their rights to a central authority,
reserving to themselves all powers of government which they
did not expressly relinquish.</p>

<p>The British Empire is an aggregate of many communities
under one common head, and is thus described by Mr.
Burke in 1774, in language which may seem to have been
somewhat too enthusiastic at the time when it was spoken,
but at the present day does not more than do justice to an
Empire which comprises one-sixth of the habitable globe in
extent and population:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;I look, I say, on the Imperial rights of Great Britain,
and the privileges which the colonies ought to enjoy under
those rights, to be just the most reconcilable things in the
world. The Parliament of Great Britain sits at the head of
<!-- Page 61 --><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61" />her extensive Empire in two capacities: one as the local
legislature of this island, providing for all things at home
immediately and by no other instrument than the executive
power; the other, and I think her nobler capacity, is what
I call her Imperial character, in which, as from the throne
of heaven, she superintends all the several Legislatures, and
guides and controls them all without annihilating any. As
all these provincial Legislatures are only co-ordinate with
each other, they ought all to be subordinate to her, else they
can neither preserve mutual peace, nor hope for mutual
justice, nor effectually afford mutual assistance.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9" /><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>The means by which the possessions of Great Britain
were acquired have been as various as the possessions themselves.
The European, Asiatic, and African possessions
became ours by conquest and cession; the American by
conquest, treaty, and settlement; the Australasian by settlement,
and by that dubious system of settlement known by
the name of annexation. Now, what is the link which
fastens each of these possessions to the mother country?
Surely it is the inherent and indestructible right of the
British Crown to exercise Imperial powers&mdash;in other words,
the supremacy of the Queen and the British Parliament?
What, again, is the common bond of union between these
vast colonial possessions, differing in laws, in religion, and
in the character of the population? The same answer must
be given: the joint and several tie, so to speak, is the same
&mdash;namely, the sovereignty of Great Britain. It is true that
the mode in which the materials composing the British
Empire have been cemented together is exactly the reverse
of the manner of the construction of the American Union.
In the case of the Union, independent States voluntarily
relinquished a portion of their sovereignty to secure national
unity, and entrusted the guardianship of that unity to a
representative body chosen by themselves. Such a union
<!-- Page 62 --><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62" />was based on contract, and could only be constructed by
communities which claimed to be independent. Far different
have been the circumstances under which England
has developed itself into the British Empire. England
began as a sovereign power, having its sovereignty vested at
first solely in the Sovereign, but gradually in the Sovereign
and Parliament. This sovereignty neither the Crown nor
the Parliament can, jointly or severally, get rid of, for it is
of the very essence of a sovereign power that it cannot, by
Act of Parliament or otherwise, bind its successors.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10" /><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> This
principle of supremacy has never been lost sight of by the
British Parliament. Their right to alter or suspend a colonial
Constitution has never been disputed. Contract never enters
into the question. The dominant authority delegates to its
subordinate communities as much or as little power as it
deems advantageous for each body, and, if it sees fit, resumes
a portion or the whole of the delegated authority. The last
point of difference to be noted between the American Constitution
and the Constitution of the British Empire is the
fact that as Minerva sprang from the brain of Jupiter fully
equipped, so the American Constitution came forth from the
hands of its framers complete and, what is of more importance,
practically in material matters unchangeable except by the
agony of an internecine war or some overwhelming passions.
The British Empire, on the other hand, is, as respects its
component members, ever in progress and flux. An Anglo-Saxon
colony, no less than a human being, has its infancy
under the maternal care of a governor, its boyhood subject
to the government of a representative council and an Executive
appointed by the Crown, its manhood under Home
Rule and responsible government, in which the Executive
are bound to vacate their offices whenever they are out-voted
<!-- Page 63 --><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63" />in the Legislature. Changes are ever taking place in the
growth, so to speak, of the several British possessions, but
what is the result? Nobody ever dreams of these changes
injuring the Imperial tie or the supremacy of the British
Parliament, that alone towers above all, unchangeable and
unimpaired; and, what is most notable, loyalty and devotion
to the Crown&mdash;that is to say, the Imperial tie&mdash;so far from
being weakened by the transition of a colony from a state of
dependence in local affairs to the higher degree of a self-governing
colony, are, on the contrary, strengthened almost
in direct proportion as the central interference with local
affairs is diminished. On this point an unimpeachable witness&mdash;Mr.
Merivale&mdash;says: &quot;What, then, are the lessons to
be learnt from a consideration of the American Constitution
and of our colonial system? Surely these: that Imperial
unity and Imperial supremacy are in no degree dependent
on the control exercised by the central power on its dependent
members.&quot; Facts, however, are more conclusive
than any arguments; and we have only to look back to the
state some forty years ago of Canada, New Zealand, and the
various colonies of Australia, and compare that state with
their condition to-day, to come to the conclusion that the
fullest power of local government is perfectly consistent with
the unity of the Empire and the supremacy of the British
Parliament. Under the old colonial Constitutions the
Executive of those colonies was under the control of the
Crown; and Mr. Merivale says &quot;that the political existence
consisted of a series of quarrels and reconciliations between
the two opposing authorities&mdash;the colonial legislative body
and the Executive nominated by the Crown.&quot; England
resolved to give up the control of the Executive, and to
grant complete responsible government&mdash;that is to say, the
Governor of each colony was instructed that his Executive
Council (or Ministry, as we should call it) must resign whenever
they were out-voted by the legislative body. The
<!-- Page 64 --><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64" />effect of this change, this relaxing, as would be supposed, of
the Imperial tie, was magical, and is thus described by Mr.
Merivale:<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11" /><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>&quot;The magnitude of that change&mdash;the extraordinary
rapidity of its beneficial effects&mdash;it is scarcely possible to
exaggerate. None but those who have traced it can realize
the sudden spring made by a young community under its
first release from the old tie of subjection, moderate as that
tie really was. The cessation, as if by magic, of the old
irritant sores between colony and mother country is the first
result. Not only are they at concord, but they seem to leave
hardly any traces in the public mind behind them. Confidence
and affection towards the home, still fondly so termed
by the colonist as well as the emigrant, seem to supersede
at once distrust and hostility. Loyalty, which was before
the badge of a class suspected by the rest of the community,
became the common watchword of all, and, with some extravagance
in the sentiment, there arises no small share of
its nobleness and devotion. Communities, which but a few
years ago would have wrangled over the smallest item of
public expenditure to which they were invited by the Executive
to contribute, have vied with each other in their subscriptions
to purposes of British interests in response to calls
of humanity, or munificence for objects but indistinctly heard
of at the distance of half the world.&quot;</p>

<p>The Dominion of Canada has been so much talked
about that it may be well to give a summary of its Constitution,
though, in so far as regards its relations to the mother
country, it differs in no material respect from any other self-governing
colony. The Dominion consists of seven provinces,
each of which has a Legislature of its own, but is at
the same time subject to the Legislature of the Dominion,
in the same manner as each State in the American Union
has a Legislature of its own, and is at the same time subject
<!-- Page 65 --><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65" />to the control of Congress. The distinguishing feature between
the system of the American States and the associated
colonies of the Dominion of Canada is this&mdash;that all Imperial
powers, everything that constitutes a people a nation as
respects foreigners, are reserved to the mother country.
The division, then, of the Dominion and its provinces consists
only in a division of Local powers. It is impossible to
mark accurately the line between Dominion and Provincial
powers, but, speaking generally, Dominion powers relate to
such matters&mdash;for example, the regulation of trade and
commerce, postal service, currency, and so forth&mdash;as require
to be dealt with on a uniform principle throughout the
whole area of a country; while the Provincial powers relate
to provincial and municipal institutions, provincial licensing,
and other subjects restricted to the limits of the province.
As a general rule, the Legislature of the Dominion and the
Legislature of each province have respectively exclusive
jurisdiction within the limits of the subjects entrusted to
them; but, as respects agriculture and immigration, the
Dominion Parliament have power to overrule any Act of
the provincial Legislatures, and, as respects property and
civil rights in Ontario, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick,
the Dominion Parliament may legislate with a view to
uniformity, but their legislation is not valid unless it is
accepted by the Legislature of each province to which
it applies.</p>

<p>The executive authority in the Dominion Government,
as in all the self-governing colonies, is carried on by the
Governor in the name of the Queen, but with the advice of
a Council: that is to say, as to all Imperial matters, he is
under the control of the mother country; as to all local
matters, he acts on the advice of his local Council. The
result of the whole is that the citizenship of an inhabitant
of the Dominion of Canada is a triple tie. Suppose him to
reside in the province of Quebec. First, he is a citizen of
<!-- Page 66 --><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66" />that province, and bound to obey all the laws which it is
within the competence of the provincial Legislature to pass.
Next, he is a citizen of the Dominion of Canada, and
acknowledges its jurisdiction in all matters outside the
legitimate sphere of the province. Lastly, and above all,
he is a subject of her Majesty. He is to all intents and
purposes, as respects the vast company of nations, an
Englishman, entitled to all the privileges as he is to all the
glory of the mother country so far as such privileges can
be enjoyed and glory participated in without actual residence
in England. One startling point of likeness in events
and unlikeness in consequences is to be found in the history
of Ireland and Canada. In 1798 Ireland rebelled. Protestant
and Catholic were arrayed in arms against each
other. The rebellion was quenched in blood, and measures
of repression have been in force, with slight intervals of
suspension, ever since, with this result&mdash;that the Ireland
of 1886 is scarcely less disloyal and discontented than the
Ireland of 1798. In 1837 and 1838 Canada rebelled.
Protestants and Catholics, differing in nationality as well as
in religion, were arrayed in arms against each other. The
rebellion was quelled with the least possible violence, a free
Constitution was given, and the Canada of 1886 is the
largest, most loyal, and most contented colony in her
Majesty's dominions.</p>

<p>Assuming, then, thus much to be proved by the Constitution
of the United States that national unity of the
closest description is consistent with complete Home Rule
in the component members of the nation, and by the history
of Canada and the British colonial empire that an Imperial
tie is sufficient to bind together for centuries dependencies
differing in situation, in nationality, in religion, in laws, in
everything that distinguishes peoples one from another, and
further and more particularly that emancipation of the
Anglo-Saxon colonies from control in their internal affairs
<!-- Page 67 --><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67" />strengthens instead of weakening Imperial unity, let us turn
to Ireland and inquire whether there is anything in the
circumstances under which Home Rule was proposed to be
granted to Ireland, or in the measures intended to establish
that Home Rule, fairly leading to the inference that disruption
of the Empire or an impairment of Imperial powers
would probably be a consequence of passing the Irish
Government Bill and the Irish Land Bill. And, first, as to
the circumstances which would seem to recommend the
Irish Home Rule Bill.</p>

<p>Ireland, from the very commencement of her connection
with England, has chafed under the restraints which that
connection imposed. The closer the apparent union
between the two countries the greater the real disunion.
The Act of 1800, <i>in words and in law</i>, effected not a union
merely, but a consolidation of the two countries. The effect
of those words and that law was to give rise to a restless
discontent, which has constantly found expression in efforts
to procure the repeal of the Act of Union and the reestablishment
of a National Parliament in Dublin. How
futile have been the efforts of the British Parliament to
diminish by concession or repress by coercion Irish aspirations
or Irish discontent it is unnecessary to discuss here.
All men admit the facts, however different the conclusions
which they draw from those facts. What Burke said of
America on moving in 1775 his resolution on conciliation
with the colonies was true in 1885 with respect to
Ireland:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;The fact is undoubted, that under former Parliaments
the state of America [read for America, Ireland] has been
kept in continual agitation. Everything administered as
remedy to the public complaint, if it did not produce, was
at least followed by an heightening of the distemper, until,
by a variety of experiments, that important country has been
brought into her present situation&mdash;a situation which I will
<!-- Page 68 --><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68" />not miscall, which I dare not name, which I scarcely know
how to comprehend in the terms of any description.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12" /><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>At length, after the election of 1885, Mr. Gladstone and
the majority of his followers came to the conclusion that an
opportunity had presented itself for providing Ireland with
a Constitution conferring on the people of that country the
largest measure of self-government consistent with the
absolute supremacy of the Crown and the Imperial Parliament
and the entire unity of the Empire. A scheme was
proposed which was accepted in principle by the representatives
of the National party in Ireland as a fair and sufficient
adjustment of the Imperial claims of Great Britain and the
Local claims of Ireland. The scheme was shortly this. A
Legislative Assembly was proposed to be established in
Ireland with power to make all laws necessary for the good
government of Ireland&mdash;in other words, invested with the
same powers of local self-government as a colonial Assembly.
The Irish Assembly was in one respect unlike a colonial
Legislature. It consisted of one House only, but this House
was divided into two orders, each of which, in case of
differences on any important legislative matter, voted
separately. This form was adopted in order to minimize
the chances of collision between the two orders, by making
it imperative on each order to hear the arguments of the
other before proceeding to a division, thus throwing on the
dissentient order the full responsibility of its dissent, with a
complete knowledge of the consequences likely to ensue
therefrom. The clause conferring on the Irish Legislature
full powers of local self-government was immediately followed
by a provision excepting, by enumeration, from any interference
on the part of the Irish Legislature, all Imperial
powers, and declaring any enactment void which infringed
on that provision. This exception (as is well known) is not
found in colonial Constitutional Acts. In them the restriction
<!-- Page 69 --><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69" />of the words of the grant to Local powers only has been
held sufficient to safeguard the supremacy of the British
Parliament and the unity of the Empire. The reason for
making a difference in the case of the Home Rule Bill was
political, not legal. Separation was declared by the enemies
of the Bill to be the real intention of its supporters, and
destruction of the unity of the Empire to be its certain
consequence. It seemed well that Ireland, by her representatives,
should accept as a satisfactory charter of Irish
liberty a document which contained an express submission
to Imperial power and a direct acknowledgment of Imperial
unity. Similarly with respect to the supremacy of the
British Parliament. In the colonial Constitutions all reference
to this supremacy is omitted as being too clear to
require notice. In the case of the Irish Home Rule Bill
instructions were given to preserve in express words the
supremacy of the British Parliament in order to pledge
Ireland to an express admission of that supremacy by the
same vote which accepted Local powers. It is true that
the wording by the draftsman of the sentence reserving the
supremacy of Parliament was justly found fault with as
inaccurate and doubtful, but that defect would have been
cured by an amendment in Committee; and, even if there
had not been any such clause in the Bill, it is clear, from
what has been said above, that the Imperial Legislature
could not, if it would, renounce its supremacy or abdicate
its sovereign powers. The executive government in Ireland
was continued in the Queen, to be carried on by the Lord
Lieutenant on behalf of her Majesty, with the aid of such
officers and Council as to her Majesty might from time to
time seem fit. Her Majesty was also a constituent part of
the Legislature, with power to delegate to the Lord
Lieutenant the prerogative of assenting to or dissenting
from Bills, and of summoning, proroguing, and dissolving
Parliament. Under these provisions the Lord Lieutenant
<!-- Page 70 --><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70" />resembled the Governor of a colony with responsible
government. He was invested with a double authority&mdash;first,
Imperial; secondly, Local. As an Imperial officer,
he was bound to veto any Bill injuriously affecting Imperial
interests or inconsistent with general Imperial policy; as a
Local officer, it was his duty to act in all local matters
according to the advice of his Council, whose tenure of
office depended on their being in harmony with, and
supported by, a majority of the Legislative Assembly.
Questions relating to the constitutionality of any particular
law were not left altogether to the decision of the Governor.
If a Bill containing a provision infringing Imperial rights
passed the Legislature, its validity might be decided in the
first instance by the ordinary courts of law, but the ultimate
appeal lay to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council,
and, with a view to secure absolute impartiality in the
Committee, it was provided that Ireland should be represented
on that body by persons who either were or had been
Irish judges. Not the least important provision of the Bill,
as respects the maintenance of Imperial interests, was the
continuance of Imperial taxation. The Customs and Excise
duties were directed to be levied, as heretofore, in pursuance
of the enactments of the Imperial Parliament, and were
excepted from the control of the Irish Legislature, which
had full power, with that exception, to impose such taxes in
Ireland as they might think expedient. The Bill further
provided that neither the Imperial taxes of Excise nor any
Local taxes that might be imposed by the Irish Legislature
should be paid into the Irish Exchequer. An Imperial
officer, called the Receiver-General, was appointed, into
whose hands the produce of every tax, both Imperial and
Local, was required to be paid, and it was the duty of the
Receiver-General to take care that all claims of the English
Exchequer, including especially the contribution payable by
Ireland for Imperial purposes, were satisfied before a farthing
<!-- Page 71 --><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71" />found its way into the Irish Exchequer for Irish purposes.
The Receiver-General was provided with an Imperial Court
to enforce his rights of Imperial taxation, and adequate
means for enforcing all Imperial powers by Imperial civil
officers. The Bill did not provide for the representation of
Ireland in the Imperial Parliament on all Imperial questions,
including questions relating to Imperial taxation, but it is
fully understood that in any Bill which might hereafter be
brought forward relating to Home Rule those defects would
be remedied.</p>

<p>An examination, then, of the Home Rule Bill, that
&quot;child of revolution and parent of separation,&quot; appears to
lead irresistibly to two conclusions. First, that Imperial
rights and Imperial powers, representation for Imperial purposes,
Imperial taxation&mdash;in short, every link that binds a
subordinate member of an Empire to its supreme head&mdash;have
been maintained unimpaired and unchanged. Secondly,
that, in granting Home Rule to discontented Ireland, that
form of responsible government has been adopted which, as
Mr. Merivale declares&mdash;and his declaration subsequent events
have more than verified&mdash;when conferred on the discontented
colonies, changed restless aspirations for separation into quiet
loyalty.</p>

<p>That such a Bill as the Home Rule Bill should be treated
as an invasion of Imperial rights is a proof of one, or perhaps
of both, the following axioms&mdash;that Bills are never
read by their accusers, and that party spirit will distort the
plainest facts. The union of Great Britain and Ireland was
not, so far as Imperial powers were concerned, disturbed by
the Bill, and an Irishman remains a citizen of the British
Empire under the Home Rule Bill, with the same obligations
and the same privileges, on the same terms as before.
All the Bill did was to make his Irish citizenship distinct
from his Imperial citizenship, in the same manner as the
citizenship of a native of the State of New York is distinct
<!-- Page 72 --><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72" />from his citizenship as a member of the United States. Now
it has been found that the Central power in the United
States has been more than a match for the State powers,
and can it be conceived for a moment that the Imperial
power of Great Britain should not be a match for the Local
power of Ireland&mdash;a State which has not one-seventh of
the population or one-twentieth part of the income of the
dominant community?</p>

<p>One argument remains to be noticed which the opponents
of Home Rule urge as absolutely condemnatory of the
measure, whereas, if properly weighed, it is conclusive in its
favour. Home Rule, they say, is a mere question of sentiment.
&quot;National aspirations&quot; are the twaddle of English
enthusiasts who know nothing of Ireland. What is really
wanted is the reform of the Land Law. Settle the agrarian
problem, and Home Rule may be relegated to the place
supposed to be paved with good intentions. The Irish will
straightway change their character, and become a law-abiding,
contented, loyal people. Be it so. But suppose it to be
proved that the establishment of an Irish Government, or,
in other words, Home Rule, is an essential condition of
agrarian reform&mdash;that the latter cannot be had without the
former&mdash;surely Home Rule should stand none the worse in
the estimation of its opponents if it not only secures a safe
basis for putting an end to agrarian exasperation, but also
gratifies the feeling of the Irish people as expressed by the
majority of its representatives in Parliament? Now, what
is the nature of the Irish Land Question? This we must
understand before considering the remedy. In Ireland
(meaning by Ireland that part of the country which is in the
hands of tenants, and falls within the compass of a Land
Bill) the tenure of land is wholly unlike that which is found
in the greater part of England. Instead of large farms in
which the landlord makes all the improvements and the
tenant pays rent for the privilege of cultivating the land and
<!-- Page 73 --><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73" />receives the produce, small holdings are found in which the
tenant does the improvements (if any) and pays a fixed rent-charge
to the owner. In England the tenant does not perform
the obligations or in any way aspire to the character of
owner. If he thinks he can get a cheaper farm, he quits his
former one, regarding his interest in the land as a mere
matter of pounds, shillings, and pence. Not so the Irish
tenant. He has made what he calls improvements, he
claims a quasi-ownership in the land, and has the characteristic
Celtic attachment for the patch of ground forming his
holding, however squalid it may be, however inadequate for
his support. In short, in Ireland there is a dual ownership&mdash;that
of the proprietor, who has no interest in the soil so
long as the tenant pays his rent and fulfils the conditions of
his tenancy; and that of the tenant, who, subject to the
payment of his rent and performance of the fixed conditions,
acts, thinks, and carries himself as the owner of his holding.
A system, then, of agrarian reform in Ireland resolves itself
into an inquiry as to the best mode of putting an end to this
dual ownership&mdash;that is to say, of making the tenant the sole
proprietor of his holding, and compensating the landlord for
his interest in the ownership. The problem is further
narrowed by the circumstance that the tenant cannot be
expected to advance any capital or pay an increased rent,
so that the means of compensating the landlord must be
found out of the existing rent.</p>

<p>The plan adopted in Mr. Gladstone's Land Bill was to
commute the rent-charges, offering the landlord, as a general
rule, twenty years' purchase on the net rental of the estate
(that is to say, the rent received by him after deducting all
outgoings), and paying him the purchase-money in &pound;3 per
cent. stock taken at par. The stock was to be advanced by
the English Government to an Irish State department at
3-1/8 per cent. interest, and the Bill provided that the tenant,
instead of rent, was to pay an annuity of &pound;4 per cent. on a
<!-- Page 74 --><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74" />capital sum equal in amount to twenty times the gross
rental.</p>

<p>The notable feature which distinguished this plan from
all other schemes was the security given for the repayment
of the purchase-money: hitherto the English Government
has lent the money directly to the landlord or tenant, and
has become the mortgagee of the land&mdash;in other words, has
become in effect the landlord of the land sold to the tenant
until the repayment of the loan has been completed. To
carry into effect under such a system any extensive scheme
of agrarian reform (and if not extensive such a reform would
be of no value in pacifying Ireland) presupposes a readiness
on the part of the English Government to become virtually
the landlord of a large portion of Ireland, with the attendant
odium of absenteeism and alien domination. Under a land
scheme such as that of 1886, all these difficulties would
be overcome. The Irish, not the English, Government
would be the virtual landlord. It would be the interest of
Ireland that the annuities due from the tenants should be
regularly paid, as, subject to the prior charge of the English
Exchequer, they would form part of the Irish revenues. The
cardinal difference, then, between Mr. Gladstone's scheme
and any other land scheme that has seen the light is this&mdash;that
in Mr. Gladstone's scheme the English loans would
have been lent to the Irish Government on the security of
the whole Irish revenues, whereas in every other scheme
they have been lent by the English Government to the Irish
creditors on the security of individual patches of land.</p>

<p>The whole question, then, of the relation between Home
Rule and agrarian reform may be summed up as follows:&mdash;Agrarian
reform is necessary for the pacification of Ireland;
agrarian reform cannot be efficiently carried into effect without
an Irish Government; an Irish Government can only be
established by a Home Rule Bill: therefore a Home Rule
Bill is necessary for the pacification of Ireland. It is idle to
<!-- Page 75 --><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75" />say, as has been said on numerous platforms, that plans no
doubt can be devised for agrarian reform without Home
Rule. The Irish revenues are the only collateral security
that can be obtained for loans of English money, and Irish
revenues are only available for the purpose on the establishment
of an Irish Government. Baronial guarantees, union
guarantees, county guarantees, debenture schemes, have all
been tried and found wanting, and vague assertions as to
possibilities are idle unless they are based on intelligible
working plans.</p>

<p>The foregoing arguments will be equally valid if, instead
of making the tenants peasant-proprietors, it were thought
desirable that the Irish State should be the proprietor and
the tenants be the holders of the land at perpetual rents and
subject to fixed conditions. Again, it might be possible to
pay the landlords by annual sums instead of capital sums.
Such matters are really questions of detail. The substance
is to interpose the Irish Government between the tenant
and the English mortgagee, and to make the loans general
charges on the whole of the Irish Government revenues as
paid into the hands of an Imperial Receiver instead of
placing them as special charges, each fixed on its own small
estate or holding. The fact that Mr. Gladstone's land
scheme was denounced as confiscation of &pound;100,000,000 of
the English taxpayers' property, while Lord Ashbourne's
Act is pronounced by the same party wise and prudent,
shows the political blindness of party spirit in its most absurd
form. Lord Ashbourne's Act requires precisely the same
expenditure to do the same work as Mr. Gladstone's Bill
requires, but in Mr. Gladstone's scheme the whole Irish
revenue was pledged as collateral security, and the Irish
Government was interposed between the ultimate creditor
and the Irish tenant, while under Lord Ashbourne's Act
the English Government figures without disguise as the landlord
of each tenant, exacting a debt which the tenant is
<!-- Page 76 --><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76" />unwilling to pay as being due to what he calls an alien
Government.</p>

<p>An endeavour has been made in the preceding pages to
prove that Home Rule in no respect infringes on Imperial
rights or Imperial unity, for the simple reason that the
Imperial power remains exactly in the same position as it
was before, the Home Rule Bill dealing only with Local
matters. At all events, Burke thought that the Imperial
supremacy alone constituted a real union between England
and Ireland. He says&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;My poor opinion is, that the closest connection between
Great Britain and Ireland is essential to the well-being&mdash;I
had almost said to the very being&mdash;of the three kingdoms;
for that purpose I humbly conceive that the whole of the
superior, and what I should call Imperial politics, ought to
have its residence here, and that Ireland, locally, civilly, and
commercially independent, ought politically to look up to
Great Britain in all matters of peace and war. In all these
points to be joined with her, and, in a word, with her to live
and to die.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13" /><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>How strange to Burke would have seemed the doctrine
that the restoration of a limited power of self-government to
Ireland, excluding commerce, and excluding all matters not
only Imperial, but those in which uniformity is required,
should be denounced as a disruption of the Empire!</p>

<p>It remains to notice one other charge made against the
Gladstonian Home Rule Bill, namely, that of impairing the
supremacy of the British Parliament. That allegation has
been shown also to be founded on a mistake. Next, it is
said that the Gladstonian scheme does not provide securities
against executive and legislative oppression. The answer is
complete. The executive authority being vested in the
Queen, it will be the duty of the Governor not to allow
executive oppression; still more will it be his duty to veto
<!-- Page 77 --><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77" />any act of legislative oppression. Further, it is stated that
difficulties will arise with respect to the power of the Privy
Council to nullify unconstitutional Acts. But it is hard to
see why a power which is exercised with success in the
United States, where all the States are equal, and without
dispute in our colonies, which are all dependent, should not
be carried into effect with equal ease in Ireland, which
is more closely bound to us and more completely under our
power than the colonies are, or than the several States are
under the power of the Central Government.</p>

<p>To conclude: the cause of Irish discontent is the conjoint
operation of the passion for nationality and the vicious
system of land tenure, and the scheme of the Irish Home
Rule Bill and the Land Bill removes the whole fabric on
which Irish discontent is raised. The Irish, by the great
majority of their representatives, have accepted the Home
Rule Bill as a satisfactory settlement of the nationality
question. The British Parliament can, through the medium
of the Home Rule Bill and the establishment of an Irish
Legislature, carry through a final settlement of agrarian disputes
with less injustice to individuals than could a Parliament
sitting in Dublin, and, be it added, with scarcely any
appreciable risk to the British taxpayer. Of course it may
be said that an Irish Parliament will go farther&mdash;that Home
Rule is a step to separation, and a reform of the Land
Laws a spoliation of the landlords. To those who urge
such arguments I would recommend the perusal of the
speech of Burke on Conciliation with America, and especially
the following sentences, substituting &quot;Ireland&quot; for
&quot;the colonies:&quot;&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;But [the Colonies] Ireland will go further. Alas! alas!
when will this speculating against fact and reason end?
What will quiet these panic fears which we entertain of the
hostile effect of a conciliatory conduct? Is it true that no
case can exist in which it is proper for the Sovereign to
<!-- Page 78 --><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78" />accede to the desires of his discontented subjects? Is there
anything peculiar in this case to make it a rule for itself?
Is all authority of course lost when it is not pushed to the
extreme? Is it a certain maxim that the fewer causes of
discontentment are left by Government the more the subject
will be inclined to resist and rebel?&quot;<!-- Page 79 --><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79" /></p>

<h2><a name="THE_IRISH_GOVERNMENT_BILL" id="THE_IRISH_GOVERNMENT_BILL" />THE IRISH GOVERNMENT BILL
AND THE IRISH LAND BILL</h2>

<p class="author">BY LORD THRING</p>


<p>A mere enumeration or analysis of the contents of the
Irish Government Bill, 1886, and the Land (Ireland) Bill,
1886, would convey scarcely any intelligible idea to the
mind of an ordinary reader. It is, therefore, proposed in
the following pages, before entering on the details of each
Bill, to give a summary of the reasons which led to its
introduction, and of the principles on which it is founded.
To begin with the Irish Government Bill&mdash;</p>

<p>The object of the Irish Government Bill is to confer on
the Irish people the largest measure of self-government
consistent with the absolute supremacy of the Crown and
Imperial Parliament and the entire unity of the Empire.
To carry into effect this object it was essential to create a
separate though subordinate legislature; thus occasion was
given to opponents to apply the name of Separatists to the
supporters of the Bill&mdash;a term true in so far only as it
denoted the intention to create a separate legislature, but
false and calumnious when used in the sense in which it
was intended to be understood&mdash;of imputing to the
promoters of the Bill the intention to disunite or in any
way to disintegrate the Empire. Indeed, the very object
of the measure was, by relaxing a little the legal bonds
of union, to draw closer the actual ties between England
<!-- Page 80 --><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80" />and Ireland, in fact, to do as we have done in our Colonies,
by decentralizing the subordinate functions of government
to strengthen the central supremacy of natural affection and
Imperial unity. The example of the effects of giving
complete self-government to our Colonies would seem not
unfavourable to trying the same experiment in Ireland.
Some forty years ago, Canada, New Zealand, and the
various colonies of Australia were discontented and uneasy
at the control exercised by the Government of England
over their local affairs. What did England do? She gave
to each of those communities the fullest power of local
government consistent with the unity of the Empire. The
result was that the real union was established in the same
degree as the apparent tie of control over local affairs was
loosened. Are there any reasons to suppose that the
condition of Ireland is such as to render the example of
the Colonies applicable? Let us look a little at the past
history of that country. Up to 1760 Ireland was governed
practically as a conquered country. The result was that in
1782, in order to save Imperial unity, we altogether relaxed
the local tie and made Ireland legislatively independent.
The Empire was thus saved, but difficulties naturally arose
between two independent legislatures. The true remedy
would have been to have imposed on Grattan's Parliament
the conditions imposed by the Irish Government Bill on
the statutory Parliament created by that Bill; the course
actually taken was that, instead of leaving the Irish with
their local government, and arranging for the due supremacy
of England, the Irish Legislature was destroyed under the
guise of Union, and Irish representatives were transferred
to an assembly in which they had little weight, and in which
they found no sympathy. The result was that from the
date of the Union to the present day Ireland has been
constantly working for the reinstatement of its National
Legislature, and has been governed by a continuous system
<!-- Page 81 --><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81" />of extraordinary legislature called coercion; the fact being
that between 1800, the date of the Act of Union, and 1832,
the date of the great Reform Act, there were only eleven
years free from coercion, while in the fifty-three years since
that period there have been only two years entirely free
from special repressive legislation. So much, therefore, is
clear, that Irish discontent at not being allowed to manage
their own affairs has gradually increased instead of diminishing.
The conclusion then would seem irresistible, that if
coercion has failed, the only practical mode of governing
Ireland satisfactorily is to give the people power to manage
their local affairs. Coming, then, to the principle of the
Bill, the first step is to reconcile local government with
Imperial supremacy, in other words, to divide Imperial
from local powers; for if this division be accurately made,
and the former class of powers be reserved to the British
Crown and British Parliament, while the latter only are
intrusted to the Irish Parliament, it becomes a contradiction
in terms to say that Imperial unity is dissolved by reserving
to the Imperial authority all its powers, or that Home Rule
is a sundering of the Imperial tie when that tie is preserved
inviolable. Imperial powers, then, are the prerogatives of
the Crown with respect to peace and war, and making
treaties with foreign nations; in short, the power of regulating
the relations of the Empire towards foreign nations.
These are the <i>jura summi imperii</i>, the very insignia of
supremacy; the attributes of sovereign authority in every
form of government, be it despotism, limited monarchy, or
republic; the only difference is that in a system of government
under one supreme head, they are vested in that head
alone, in a federal government, as in America or Switzerland,
they reside in the composite body forming the federal
supreme authority. Various subsidiary powers necessarily
attend the above supreme powers; for example, the power
of maintaining armies and navies, of commanding the
<!-- Page 82 --><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82" />militia, and other incidental powers. Closely connected
with the power of making peace and war is the power of
regulating commerce with foreign nations. Next in importance
to the reservations necessary to constitute the
Empire a Unity with regard to foreign nations, are the powers
required to prevent disputes and to facilitate intercourse
between the various parts of the Empire. These are the
coinage of money and other regulations relating to currency,
to copyright or other exclusive rights to the use or profit of
any works or inventions. The above subjects must be
altogether excluded from the powers of the subordinate
legislature; it ceases to be subordinate as soon as it is
invested with these Imperial, or quasi-Imperial, powers.</p>

<p>Assuming, however, the division between Imperial and
local powers to be accurately determined, how is the
subordinate legislative body to be kept within its due limits?
The answer is very plain,&mdash;an Imperial court must be
established to decide in the last resort whether the subordinate
legislature has or has not infringed Imperial rights.
Such a court has been in action in the United States of
America ever since their union, and no serious conflict has
arisen in carrying its decisions into effect, and the Privy
Council, acting as the Supreme Court in respect to Colonial
appeals, has been accepted by all the self-governing colonies
as a just and impartial expositor of the meaning of their
several constitutions.</p>

<p>Next in importance to the right division of Imperial and
local powers is a correct understanding of the relation borne
by the executive of an autonomous country to the mother
country. In every part of the British Empire which enjoys
home rule the legislature consists of the Queen and the two
local legislative bodies. The administrative power resides
in the Queen alone. The Queen has the appointment of
all the officers of the government; money bills can be introduced
into the legislature only with the consent of the<!-- Page 83 --><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83" />
Queen. The initiative power of taxation then is vested
in the Queen, the executive head, in practice represented
by the Governor. But such a power of initiation is of course
useless unless the legislative body is willing to support the
executive, and grants it the necessary funds for carrying on
the government. What, then, is the contrivance by which the
governmental machine is prevented from being stopped by
a difference between the executive and legislative authorities?
It is the same in the mother country, and in every British
home-rule country, with this difference only&mdash;that beyond
the limits of the mother country the Queen is represented
by a governor to whom are delegated such a measure of
powers as is necessary for the supreme head of a local self-governing
community. The contrivance is this in the
mother country:&mdash;the Queen acts upon the advice of a
cabinet council; in home-rule dependencies the Governor
acts on the advice of a local council. If this cabinet council
in the mother country, or local council in a dependency,
ceases to command a majority in the popular legislative
body, it resigns, and the Governor is obliged to select a
council which, by commanding such a majority, can obtain
the supplies necessary to carry on the government. The
consequence then is, that in a home-rule community, if a
serious difficulty arises between the legislative and executive
authority, the head of the executive, the governor, refers the
ultimate decision of the question to the general body of
electors by dissolving the popular legislative body. It has
been urged in the discussion on the Irish Government Bill
that the powers of the executive in relation to the legislative
body ought to be expressed in the Bill itself; but it is clear
to anybody acquainted with the rudiments of legislation that
the details of such a system (in other words, the mode in
which a governor ought to act under the endless variety of
circumstances which may occur in governing a dependency)
never have been and never can be expressed in an Act of<!-- Page 84 --><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84" />
Parliament. But how little difficulty this absence of definition
has caused may be judged from the fact that neither in
England nor in any of her home-rule dependencies has any
vital collision arisen between the executive and legislative
authorities, and that all the home-rule colonies have
managed to surmount the obstacles which the opponents
of Home Rule argued would be fatal to their existence.
The main principles have now been stated on which the
Irish Government Bill is framed, and it remains to give
a summary of the provisions of the Bill, the objects and
bearing of which will be readily understood from the foregoing
observations. The first clause provides that&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;On and after the appointed day there shall be established
in Ireland a Legislature consisting of Her Majesty the
Queen and an Irish legislative body.&quot;</p>

<p>This is the first step in all English constitutional systems,
to vest the power of legislation in the Queen and the legislative
body. Such a legislature might have had conferred
on it the independent powers vested in Grattan's Parliament:
but the second clause at once puts an end to any doubt as
to the subordination of the Irish legislative body; for while
on the one hand it confers full powers of local self-government,
by declaring that the Legislature may make any laws
for the peace, order, and good government of Ireland, it
subjects that power to numerous exceptions and restrictions.
The exceptions are contained in the third clause, and the
restrictions in the fourth. The exceptions are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;The Legislature of Ireland shall not make laws relating
to the following matters or any of them:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;(1.) The status or dignity of the Crown, or the succession
to the Crown, or a Regency;</p>

<p>&quot;(2.) The making of peace or war;</p>

<p>&quot;(3.) The army, navy, militia, volunteers, or other
military or naval forces, or the defence of the realm;</p>

<p>&quot;(4.) Treaties and other relations with foreign States,
<!-- Page 85 --><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85" />or the relations between the various parts of Her Majesty's
dominions;</p>

<p>&quot;(5.) Dignities or titles of honour;</p>

<p>&quot;(6.) Prize or booty of war;</p>

<p>&quot;(7.) Offences against the law of nations; or offences
committed in violation of any treaty made, or hereafter to
be made, between Her Majesty and any foreign State; or
offences committed on the high seas;</p>

<p>&quot;(8.) Treason, alienage, or naturalization;</p>

<p>&quot;(9.) Trade, navigation, or quarantine;</p>

<p>&quot;(10.) The postal and telegraph service, except as hereafter
in this Act mentioned with respect to the transmission
of letters and telegrams in Ireland;</p>

<p>&quot;(11.) Beacons, lighthouses, or sea-marks;</p>

<p>&quot;(12.) The coinage; the value of foreign money; legal
tender; or weights and measures; or</p>

<p>&quot;(13.) Copyright, patent rights, or other exclusive rights
to the use or profits of any works or inventions.&quot;</p>

<p>Of these exceptions the first four preserve the imperial
rights which have been insisted on above, and maintain the
position of Ireland as an integral portion of that Empire of
which Great Britain is the head. The remaining exceptions
are either subsidiary to the first four, or relate, as is the case
with exceptions 10 to 13, to matters on which it is desirable
that uniformity should exist throughout the whole Empire.
The restrictions in clause 4 are:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;The Irish Legislature shall not make any law&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;(1.) Respecting the establishment or endowment of
religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or</p>

<p>&quot;(2.) Imposing any disability, or conferring any privilege,
on account of religious belief; or</p>

<p>&quot;(3.) Abrogating or derogating from the right to establish
or maintain any place of denominational education or
any denominational institution or charity; or</p>

<p>&quot;(4.) Prejudicially affecting the right of any child to
<!-- Page 86 --><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86" />attend a school receiving public money without attending
the religious instruction at that school; or</p>

<p>&quot;(5.) Impairing, without either the leave of Her Majesty
in Council first obtained on an address presented by the
legislative body of Ireland, or the consent of the corporation
interested, the rights, property, or privileges of any existing
corporation incorporated by royal charter or local and
general Act of Parliament; or</p>

<p>&quot;(6.) Imposing or relating to duties of customs and
duties of excise, as defined by this Act, or either of such
duties, or affecting any Act relating to such duties or either
of them; or</p>

<p>&quot;(7.) Affecting this Act, except in so far as it is declared
to be alterable by the Irish Legislature.&quot;</p>

<p>These restrictions differ from the exceptions, inasmuch
as they do not prevent the Legislature of Ireland from dealing
with the subjects to which they refer, but merely impose
on it an obligation not to handle the specified matters in a
manner detrimental to the interests of certain classes of Her
Majesty's subjects. For example, restrictions 1 to 4 are
practically concerned in securing religious freedom; restriction
5 protects existing charters; restriction 6 is necessary,
as will be seen hereinafter, to carrying into effect the financial
scheme of the bill; restriction 7 is a consequence of the
very framework of the Bill: it provides for the stability of
the Irish constitution, by declaring that the Irish Legislature
is not competent to alter the constitutional act to which it
owes its existence, except on those points on which it is
expressly permitted to make alterations.</p>

<p>Clause 5 is an exposition, so to speak, of the consequence
which would seem to flow from the fact of the Queen being
a constitutional part of the Legislature. It states that the
royal prerogatives with respect to the summoning, prorogation,
and dissolution of the Irish legislative body are to be
the same as the royal prerogatives in relation to the Imperial<!-- Page 87 --><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87" />
Parliament. The next clause (6) is comparatively immaterial;
it merely provides that the duration of the Irish legislative
body is to be quinquennial. As it deals with a matter of
detail, it perhaps would have more aptly found a place in a
subsequent part of the Bill. Clause 7 passes from the
legislative to the executive authority; it declares:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1.) The executive government of Ireland shall continue
vested in Her Majesty, and shall be carried on by the Lord
Lieutenant on behalf of Her Majesty with the aid of such
officers and such council as to Her Majesty may from time
to time seem fit.</p>

<p>(2.) Subject to any instructions which may from time to
time be given by Her Majesty, the Lord Lieutenant shall
give or withhold the assent of Her Majesty to bills passed
by the Irish legislative body, and shall exercise the prerogatives
of Her Majesty in respect of the summoning, proroguing,
and dissolving of the Irish legislative body, and any
prerogatives the exercise of which may be delegated to him
by Her Majesty.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind what has been said in the preliminary
observations in respect of the relation between the executive
and the legislative authority, it will be at once understood
how much this clause implies, according to constitutional
maxims, of the dependence on the one hand of the Irish
executive in respect of imperial matters, and of its independence
in respect of local matters. The clause is practically
co-ordinate and correlative with the clause conferring complete
local powers on the Irish Legislature, while it preserves
all imperial powers to the Imperial Legislature. The
governor is an imperial officer, and will be bound to watch
over imperial interests with a jealous scrutiny, and to veto
any bill which may be injurious to those interests. On the
other hand, as respects all local matters, he will act on and
be guided by the advice of the Irish executive council.
The system is, as has been shown above, self-acting. The
<!-- Page 88 --><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88" />governor, for local purposes, must have a council which is
in harmony with the legislative body. If a council, supported
by the legislative body and the governor do not
agree, the governor must give way unless he can, by dismissing
his council and dissolving the legislative body,
obtain both a council and a legislative body which will
support his views. As respects imperial questions, the case
is different; here the last word rests with the mother country,
and in the last resort a determination of the executive council,
backed by the legislative body, to resist imperial rights, must
be deemed an act of rebellion on the part of the Irish people,
and be dealt with accordingly.</p>

<p>The above clauses contain the pith and marrow of the
whole scheme. The exact constitution of the legislative
body, and the orders into which it should be divided, the
exclusion or non-exclusion of the Irish members from the
Imperial Parliament, indeed, the whole of the provisions
found in the remainder of this Bill, are matters which might
be altered without destroying, or even violently disarranging,
the Home-rule scheme as above described.</p>

<p>Clauses 9, 10, and 11 provide for the constitution of the
legislative body; it differs materially from the colonial legislative
bodies, and from the Legislature of the United States.
For the purpose of deliberation it consists of one House
only; for the purpose of voting on all questions (except
interlocutory applications and questions of order), it is
divided into two classes, called in the Bill &quot;Orders,&quot; each
of which votes separately, with the result that a question on
which the two orders disagree is deemed to be decided in
the negative. The object of this arrangement is to diminish
the chances of collision between the two branches of the
Legislature, which have given rise to so much difficulty both
in England and the colonies. Each order will have ample
opportunity of learning the strength and hearing the arguments
of the other order. They will therefore, each of
<!-- Page 89 --><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89" />them, proceed to a division with a full sense of the responsibility
attaching to their action. A further safeguard is provided
against a final conflict between the first and second
orders. If the first order negative a proposition, that negative
is in force only for a period of three years, unless a dissolution
takes place sooner, in which case it is terminated at
once; the lost bill or clause may then be submitted to the
whole House, and if decided in the affirmative, and assented
to by the Queen, becomes law. The first order of the Irish
legislative body comprises 103 members. It is intended to
consist ultimately wholly of elective members; but for the
next immediate period of thirty years the rights of the Irish
representative peers are, as will be seen, scrupulously reserved.
The plan is this: of the 103 members composing the first
order, seventy-five are elective, and twenty-eight peerage
members. The qualification of the elective members is an
annual income of &pound;200, or the possession of a capital sum
of &pound;4000 free from all charges. The elections are to be
conducted in the electoral districts set out in the schedule
to the Bill. The electors must possess land or tenements
within the district of the annual value of &pound;25. The
twenty-eight peerage members consist of the existing
twenty-eight representative peers, and any vacancies in
their body during the next thirty years are to be filled up
in the manner at present in use respecting the election of
Irish representative peers. The Irish representative peers
cease to sit in the English Parliament; but a member of
that body is not required to sit in the Irish Parliament without
his assent, and the place of any existing peer refusing to
sit in the Irish Parliament will be filled up as in the case of
an ordinary vacancy. The elective members of the first
order sit for ten years; every five years one half their number
will retire. The members of the first order do not vacate
their seats on a dissolution of the legislative body. At the
expiration of thirty years, that is to say, upon the exhaustion
<!-- Page 90 --><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90" />of all the existing Irish representative peers, the whole of
the upper order will consist of elective members. The
second order consists of 204 members, that is to say, of the
103 existing Irish members (who are transferred to the Irish
Parliament), and of 101 additional members to be elected
by the county districts and the represented towns, in the
same manner as that in which the present 101 members for
counties and towns are elected&mdash;each constituency returning
two instead of one member. If an existing member does
not assent to his transfer, his seat is vacated.</p>

<p>A power is given to the Legislature of Ireland to enable
the Royal University of Ireland to return two members.</p>

<p>The provisions with respect to this second order fall
within the class of enactments which are alterable by the
Irish Legislature. After the first dissolution of parliament
the Irish Legislature may deal with the second order in any
manner they think fit, with the important restrictions:&mdash;(1)
That in the distribution of members they must have due
regard to population; (2) that they must not increase or
diminish the number of members.</p>

<p>The transfer to the Irish legislative body of the Irish
representative peers, and of the Irish members, involves
their exclusion under ordinary circumstances from the Imperial
Parliament, with this great exception, that whenever
an alteration is proposed to be made in the fundamental
provisions of the Irish Government Bill, a mode of procedure
is devised for recalling both orders of the Irish
legislative body to the Imperial Parliament for the purpose
of obtaining their consent to such alteration (clause 39).</p>

<p>Further, it is right to state here that Mr. Gladstone in
his speech on the second reading of the Bill proposed to
provide, &quot;that when any proposal for taxation was made
affecting the condition of Ireland, Irish members should
have an opportunity of appearing in the House to take a
share in the transaction of that business.&quot;</p>

<p><!-- Page 91 --><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91" />Questions arising as to whether the Irish Parliament has
or not exceeded its constitutional powers may be determined
by the ordinary courts of law in the first instance; the
ultimate appeal lies to the Judicial Committee of the Privy
Council. An additional safeguard is provided by declaring
that before a provision in a Bill becomes law, the Lord
Lieutenant may take the opinion of the Judicial Committee
of the Privy Council as to its legality, and further, that
without subjecting private litigants to the expense of trying
the constitutionality of an Act, the Lord Lieutenant may, of
his own motion, move the judicial committee to determine
the question. With a view to secure absolute impartiality
in the committee, Ireland will be represented on that body
by persons who are or have been Irish judges (clause 25).</p>

<p>The question of finance forms a separate portion of the
Bill, the provisions of which are contained in clauses twelve
to twenty, while the machinery for carrying those enactments
into effect will be found in Part III. of the Land Bill.
The first point to be determined was the amount to be
contributed by Ireland to imperial expenses. Under the
Act of Union it was intended that Ireland should pay 2/17ths,
or in the proportion of 1 to 7-1/2 of the total expenditure of
the United Kingdom. This amount being found exorbitant,
it was gradually reduced, until at the present moment it
amounts to something under the proportion of 1 to 11-1/2.
The bill fixes the proportion at 1/15th, or 1 to 14, this sum
being arrived at by a comparison between the amount of
the income-tax, death-duties, and valuation of property in
Great Britain, and the amount of the same particulars in
Ireland. The amount to be contributed by Ireland to the
imperial expenditure being thus ascertained, the more difficult
part of the problem remained to provide the fund out
of which the contribution should be payable, and the mode
in which its payment should be secured. The plan which
commended itself to the framers of the Bill, as combining
<!-- Page 92 --><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92" />the advantage of insuring the fiscal unity of Great Britain
and Ireland, with absolute security to the British exchequer,
was to continue the customs and excise duties under imperial
control, and to pay them into the hands of an imperial
officer. This plan is carried into effect by the conjoint
operation of the clauses of the Irish Government Bill and
the Irish Land Bill above referred to. The customs and
excise duties are directed to be levied as heretofore in
pursuance of the enactments of the Imperial Parliament,
and are excepted from the control of the Irish Legislature,
which may, with that exception, impose any taxes in Ireland
it may think expedient. The imperial officer who is appointed
under the Land Bill bears the title of Receiver-General,
and into his hands not only the imperial taxes (the
customs and excise duties), but also all local taxes imposed
by the Irish Parliament are in the first instance paid. (See
Clauses 25-27 of the Land Bill.) The Receiver-General
having thus in his hands all imperial and local funds levied
in Ireland, his duty is to satisfy all imperial claims before
paying over any moneys to the Irish Exchequer. Further,
an Imperial Court of Exchequer is established in Ireland
to watch over the interests of the Receiver-General, and all
revenue cases are to be tried, and all defaults punished in
that court. Any neglect of the local authorities to carry
into effect the decrees of the Imperial Court will amount to
treason, and it will be the duty of the Imperial Government
to deal with it accordingly.</p>

<p>Supposing the Bill to have passed, the account of the
Exchequer in Ireland would have stood thus:&mdash;<!-- Page 93 --><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93" /></p>

<p><!-- Page 94 --><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94" />The Imperial contribution payable by Ireland to Great
Britain cannot be increased for thirty years, though it may
be diminished if the charges for the army and navy and
Imperial civil expenditure for any year be less than fifteen
times the contribution paid by Ireland, in which case 1/15th
of the diminution will be deducted from the annual Imperial
contribution. Apart from the Imperial charges there are
other charges strictly Irish, for the security of the payment
of which the Bill provides. This it does by imposing an
obligation on the Irish legislative body to enact sufficient
taxes to meet such charges, and by directing them to be
paid by the Imperial Receiver-General, who is required to
keep an imperial and an Irish account, carrying the customs
and excise duties, in the first instance, to the imperial
account, and the local taxes to the Irish account, transferring
to the Irish account the surplus remaining after paying
the imperial charges on the imperial account. On this Irish
account are charged debts due from the Government of
Ireland, pensions, and other sums due to the civil servants,
and the salaries of the judges of the supreme courts in
Ireland.</p>

<p>Some provisions of importance remain to be noticed.
Judges of the superior and county courts in Ireland are to
be removable from office only on address to the Crown,
presented by both orders of the Legislative body voting
separately. Existing Civil servants are retained in their
offices at their existing salaries; if the Irish Government
desire their retirement, they will be entitled to pensions; on
the other hand, if at the end of two years the officers themselves
wish to retire, they can do so, and will be entitled to
the same pensions as if their office had been abolished.
The pensions are payable by the Receiver-General out of
the Irish account above mentioned.</p>

<p>The supremacy of the Imperial Parliament over all parts
of the Empire is an inherent quality of which Parliament
<!-- Page 95 --><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95" />cannot divest itself, inasmuch as it cannot bind its successors
or prevent them from repealing any prior Act. In order,
however, to prevent any misapprehension on this point clause
37 was inserted, the efficacy of which, owing in great measure
to a misprint, has been doubted. It is enough to state here
that it was intended by express legislation to reserve all
powers to the Imperial Parliament, and had the Bill gone
into Committee the question would have been placed beyond
the reach of cavil by a slight alteration in the wording of
the clause. This summary may be concluded by the statement
that the appellate jurisdiction of the House of Lords
over actions and suits arising in Ireland (except in respect
of constitutional questions reserved for the determination of
the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council as explained
above), and with respect to claims for Irish Peerages, is
preserved intact.</p>

<p>The object of the Land Bill was a political one: to
promote the contentment of the people, and the cause
of good government in Ireland, by settling once and for
ever the vexed question relating to land. To do this
effectually it was necessary to devise a system under which
the tenants, as a class, should become interested in the
maintenance of social order, and be furnished with substantial
inducements to rally round the institutions of their
country. On the other hand, it was just and right that
the landlords should participate in the benefits of any
measure proposed for remedying the evils attendant upon
the tenure of land in Ireland; and should be enabled to rid
themselves, on fair terms, of their estates in cases where,
from apprehension of impending changes, or for pecuniary
reasons, they were desirous of relieving themselves from the
responsibilities of ownership. Further, it was felt by the
framers of the Bill that a moral obligation rested on the
Imperial Government to remove, if possible, &quot;the fearful
exasperations attending the agrarian relations in Ireland,&quot;<!-- Page 96 --><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96" />
rather than leave a question so fraught with danger, and so
involved in difficulty, to be determined by the Irish Government
on its first entry on official existence. Such were the
governing motives for bringing in the Land Bill.</p>

<p>To understand an Irish Land Bill it is necessary to
dismiss at once all ideas of the ordinary relations between
landlord and tenant in England, and to grasp a true conception
of the condition of an Irish tenanted estate. In
England the relation between the landlord and tenant of
a farm resembles, with a difference in the subject-matter, the
relation between the landlord and tenant of a furnished
house. In the case of the house, the landlord keeps it in
a state fit for habitation, and the tenant pays rent for the
privilege of living in another man's house. In the case of
the farm, the landlord provides the farm with house, farm-buildings,
gates, and other permanent improvements required
to fit it for cultivation by the tenant, and the tenant pays
rent for the privilege of cultivating the farm, receiving the
proceeds of that cultivation. The characters of owner
and tenant, however long the connection between them may
subsist, are quite distinct. The tenant does no acts of
ownership, and never regards the land as belonging to
himself, quitting it without hesitation if he can make more
money by taking another farm. In Ireland the whole
situation is different: instead of a farm of some one hundred
or two hundred acres, the tenant has a holding varying, say,
from five to fifty acres, for which he pays an annual rent-charge
to the landlord. He, or his ancestors have, in the
opinion of the tenant, acquired a quasi-ownership in the
land by making all the improvements, and he is only
removable on non-payment of the fixed rent, or non-fulfilment
of certain specified conditions. In short, in
Ireland the ownership is dual: the landlord is merely the
lord of a quasi-copyhold manor, consisting of numerous
small tenements held by quasi-copyholders who, so long as
<!-- Page 97 --><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97" />they pay what may be called the manorial rents, and fulfil
the manorial conditions, regard themselves as independent
owners of their holdings. An Irish Land Bill, then, dealing
with tenanted estates, is, in fact, merely a Bill for converting
the small holders of tenements held at a fixed rent
into fee-simple owners by redemption of the rent due to the
landlord and a transfer of the land to the holders. Every
scheme, therefore, for settling the Land question in Ireland
resolves itself into an inquiry as to the best mode of paying
off the rent-charges due to the landlord. The tenant
cannot, of course, raise the capital sufficient for paying off
the redemption money; some State authority must, therefore,
intervene and advance the whole or the greater part of
that money, and recoup itself for the advance by the creation
in its own favour of an annual charge on the holding
sufficient to repay in a certain number of years both the
principal and interest due in respect of the advance.</p>

<p>The first problem, then, in an Irish Land Bill, is to settle
the conditions of this annuity in such a manner as to satisfy
the landlord and tenant; the first, as to the price of his
estate; the second, as to the amount of the annuity to be
paid by him, at the same time to provide the State authority
with adequate security for the repayment of the advance, or,
in other words, for the punctual payments of the annuity
which is to discharge the advance. Next in importance to
the financial question of the adjustment of the annuity
comes the administrative difficulty of investigating the title,
and thus securing to the tenant the possession of the fee
simple, and to the State authority the position of a mortgagee.
Under ordinary circumstances the investigation of
the title to an estate involves the examination of every
document relating thereto for a period of forty years, and
the distribution of the purchase-money amongst the head
renters, mortgagees, and other encumbrancers, who, in
addition to the landlord, are found to be interested in the
<!-- Page 98 --><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98" />ownership of almost every Irish estate. Such a process is
costly, even in the case of large estates, and involves an
expense almost, and, indeed, speaking generally, absolutely
prohibitory in the case of small properties. Some mode,
then, must be devised for reducing this expense within
manageable limits, or any scheme for dealing with Irish
land, however well devised from a financial point of view,
will sink under the burden imposed by the expense attending
the transfer of the land to the new proprietors. Having
thus stated the two principal difficulties attending the Land
question in Ireland, it may be well before entering on the
details of the Sale and Purchase of Land (Ireland) Bill, to
mention the efforts which have been made during the last
fifteen years to surmount those difficulties. The Acts having
this object in view are the Land Acts of 1870, 1872, and
1881, brought in by Mr. Gladstone, and the Land Purchase
Act of 1885, brought in by the Conservative Lord Chancellor
of Ireland (Lord Ashbourne). The Act of 1870, as amended
by the Act of 1872, provided that the State authority might
advance two-thirds of the purchase-money. An attempt was
made to get over the difficulties of title by providing that
the Landed Estates Court or Board of Works shall undertake
the investigation of the title and the transfer and distribution
of the purchase-money at a fixed price. The Act of 1881
increased the advance to three-quarters, leaving the same
machinery to deal with the title. Both under the Acts of
1870 and 1881 the advance was secured by an annuity of
5 per cent., payable for the period of thirty-five years, and
based on the loan of the money by the English Exchequer
at 3-1/2 per cent. interest. These Acts produced very little
effect. The expense of dealing with the titles in the Landed
Estates Court proved overwhelming, and neither the Board
of Works, under the Act of 1872, nor the Land Commission,
under the Act of 1881, found themselves equal to the task
of completing inexpensively the transfer of the land;
<!-- Page 99 --><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99" />further, the tenants had no means of providing even the
quarter of the purchase-money required by the Act of 1881.
In 1885 Lord Ashbourne determined to remove all obstacles
at the expense of the English Exchequer. By the Land
Act of that year he authorized the whole of the purchase-money
to be advanced by the State, with a guarantee by
the landlord, to be carried into effect by his allowing
one-fifth of the purchase-money to remain in the hands of
the agents of the State Authority until one-fifth of the
purchase-money had been repaid by the annual payments
of the tenants. The principal was to be recouped by an
annuity of 4 per cent., extending over a period of forty-nine
years, instead of an annuity of 5 per cent. extending over a
period of thirty-five years. The English Exchequer was to
advance the money on the basis of interest at 3-1/8 per cent.,
instead of at 3-1/2 per cent. Though sufficient time has not
yet elapsed to show whether the great bribe offered by the
Act of 1885, at the expense of the British taxpayer, will
succeed in overcoming the apathy of the tenants, it cannot
escape notice that if the Act of 1885 succeeds better than
the previous Acts, it will owe that success solely to the
greater amount of risk which it imposes on the English
Exchequer, and not to any improvement in the scheme in
respect of securing greater certainty of sale to the Irish
landlord, or of diminishing the danger of loss to the English
taxpayer.</p>

<p>Such being the state of legislation, and such the circumstances
of the land question in Ireland in the year 1886,
the Irish Government Bill afforded Mr. Gladstone the
means and the opportunity of bringing in a Land Bill
which would secure to the Irish landlord the certainty of
selling his land at a fair price, without imposing any
practical liability on the English Exchequer, and would, at
the same time, diminish the annual sums payable by the
tenant; while it also conferred a benefit on the Irish<!-- Page 100 --><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100" />
Exchequer. These advantages were, as will be seen, gained,
firstly, by the pledge of English credit on good security,
instead of advancing money on a mere mortgage on Irish
holdings, made directly to the English Government; and,
secondly, by the interposition of the Irish Government, as
the immediate creditor of the Irish tenant. The scheme of
the Land Purchase Bill is as follows:&mdash;The landlord of an
agricultural estate occupied by tenants may apply to a
department of the new Irish Government to purchase his
estate. The tenants need not be consulted, as the purchase,
if completed, will necessarily better their condition, and
thus at the very outset the difficulty of procuring the assent
of the tenants, which has hitherto proved so formidable an
obstacle to all Irish land schemes, disappears. The landlord
may require the department to which he applies (called in
the Bill the State Authority) to pay him the statutory price
of his estate, not in cash, but in consols valued at par.
This price, except in certain unusual cases of great goodness
or of great badness of the land, is twenty years' purchase
of the <i>net</i> rental. The <i>net</i> rental is the <i>gross</i> rental after
deducting from that rent tithe rent-charge, the average
percentage for expenses in respect of bad debts, any rates
paid by the landlord, and any like outgoings. The <i>gross</i>
rental of an estate is the gross rent of all the holdings on
the estate, payable in the year ending in November, 1885.
Where a judicial rent has been fixed, it is the judicial rent;
where no judicial rent has been fixed, it is the rent to be
determined in the manner provided by the Bill.</p>

<p>To state this shortly, the Bill provides that an Irish
landlord may require the State Authority to pay him for
his estate, in consols valued at par, a capital sum equal to
twenty times the amount of the annual sum which he has
actually put into his pocket out of the proceeds of the
estate. The determination of the statutory price is, so far
as the landlord is concerned, the cardinal point of the Bill,
<!-- Page 101 --><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101" />and in order that no injustice may be done the landlord,
an Imperial Commission&mdash;called the Land Commission&mdash;is
appointed by the Bill, whose duty it is to fix the statutory
price, and, where there is no judicial rent, to determine the
amount of rent which, in the character of gross rental, is to
form the basis of the statutory price. The Commission also
pay the purchase-money to the landlord, or distribute it
amongst the parties entitled, and generally the Commission
act as intermediaries between the landlord and the Irish
State Authority, which has no power of varying the terms
to which the landlord is entitled under the Bill, or of
judging of the conditions which affect the statutory price.
If the landlord thinks the price fixed by the Land Commission,
as the statutory price inequitable, he may reject
their offer and keep his estate.</p>

<p>Supposing, however, the landlord to be satisfied with
the statutory price offered by the Land Commission, the
sale is concluded, and the Land Commission make an
order carrying the required sum of consols (which is for
convenience hereinafter called the purchase-money,
although it consists of stock and not of cash) to the
account of the estate in their books after deducting 1 per
cent. for the cost of investigation of title and distribution
of the purchase-money, and upon the purchase-money being
thus credited to the estate, the landlord ceases to have any
interest in the estate, and the tenants, by virtue of the order
of the Land Commission, become owners in fee simple of
their holdings, subject to the payment to the Irish State
Authority of an annuity. The amount of the annuity is
stated in the Bill. It is a sum equal to &pound;4 per cent.
on a capital sum equal to twenty times the amount of the
gross rental of the holding. The illustration given by
Mr. Gladstone in his speech will at once explain these apparently
intricate matters of finance. A landlord is entitled
to the Hendon estate, producing &pound;1200 a year gross
<!-- Page 102 --><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102" />rental; to find the net rental, the Land Commission deduct
from this gross rental outgoings estimated at about 20 per
cent., or &pound;240 a year. This makes the net rental &pound;960
a year, and the price payable to the landlord is &pound;19,200
(twenty years' purchase of &pound;960, or &pound;960 multiplied by
20), which, as above stated, will be paid in consols. The
tenants will pay, as the maximum amount for their holdings,
&pound;4 per cent. for forty-nine years on the capitalized value of
twenty years' purchase of the gross rent. This will amount
to &pound;960 instead of &pound;1,200, which they have hitherto paid;
a saving of &pound;240 a year will thus be effected, from which,
however, must be deducted the half rates to which they will
become liable, formerly paid by the landlord. This &pound;4 per
cent. charge payable by the tenants will continue for forty-nine
years, but at the end of that time each tenant will
become a free owner of his estate without any annual payment.
Next, as to the position of the State Authority.
The State Authority receives &pound;960 from the tenants; it
pays out of that sum &pound;4 per cent., not upon the gross
rental, but upon the net rental capitalized, that is to say,
&pound;768 to the Imperial Exchequer. The State Authority,
therefore, receives,&pound;960, and assuming that the charge of
collecting the rental is 2 per cent., that is to say, &pound;19 4<i>s.</i>,
the State Authority will, out of &pound;960, have to disburse
only &pound;787 4<i>s.</i>, leaving it a gainer of &pound;172 16<i>s.</i>, or nearly
18 per cent. The result then between the several parties
is, the landlord receives &pound;19,200; the tenantry pay &pound;240
a year less than they have hitherto paid, and at the end of
forty-nine years are exempt altogether from payment; the
gain of Irish State Authority is &pound;172 16<i>s.</i> a year. Another
mode of putting the case shortly is as follows: The English
Exchequer lends the money to the Irish State Authority at
3-1/8 per cent. and an annuity of 4 per cent. paid during
forty-nine years will, as has been stated above, repay both
principal and interest for every &pound;100 lent at 3-1/8 per cent.<!-- Page 103 --><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103" />
On the sale of an estate under the Bill, the landlord receives
twenty years' purchase; the tenant pays &pound;4 per cent. on
twenty years' purchase of the gross rental; the Irish State
Authority receives &pound;4 per cent. on the gross rental; the
English Exchequer receives 4 per cent. on the net rental
only. The repayment of the interest due by the Irish
Authority to the English Exchequer is in no wise dependent
on the punctual payment of their annuities by the Irish
tenants, nor does the English Government in any way
figure as the landlord or creditor of the Irish tenants. The
annuities payable by the tenants are due to the Irish
Government, and collected by them, while the interest due
to the English Government is a charge on the whole of the
Irish Government funds; and further, these funds themselves
are paid into the hands of the Imperial officer,
whose duty it is to liquidate the debt due to his master, the
Imperial Exchequer, before a sixpence can be touched by
the Irish Government. It is not, then, any exaggeration to
say that the Land Purchase Bill of 1886 provides for the
settlement of the Irish Land question without any appreciable
risk to the English Exchequer, and with the advantage
of securing a fair price for the landlord, a diminution of
annual payments to the tenant with the ultimate acquisition
of the fee simple, also a gain of no inconsiderable sum to
the Irish Exchequer. In order to obviate the difficulties
attending the investigation of title and transfer of the property,
the Bill provides, as stated above, that on the completion
of the agreement for the sale between the landlord
and the Commission, the holding shall vest at once in the
tenants: it then proceeds to declare that the claims of all
persons interested in the land shall attach to the purchase-money
in the same manner as though it were land. The
duty of ascertaining these claims and distributing the
purchase-money is vested in the Land Commission, who
undertake the task in exchange for the 1 per cent. which
<!-- Page 104 --><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104" />they have, as above stated, deducted from the purchase-money
as the cost of conducting the complete transfer of
the estate from the landlord to the tenants. The difficulty
of the process of dealing with the purchase-money depends,
of course, on the intricacy of the title. If the vendor is the
sole unencumbered owner, he is put in immediate possession
of the stock constituting the price of the estate. If
there are encumbrances, as is usually the case, they are
paid off by the Land Commission. Capital sums are paid
in full; jointures and other life charges are valued according
to the usual tables. Drainage and other temporary charges
are estimated at their present value, permanent rent-charges
are valued by agreement, or in case of disagreement, by the
Land Commission; a certain minimum number of years'
purchase being assigned by the Bill to any permanent rent-charge
which amounts only to one-fifth part of the rental of
the estate on which it is charged, this provision being made
to prevent injustice being done to the holders of rent-charges
which are amply secured.</p>

<p>It remains to notice certain other points of some importance.
The landlord entitled to require the State to
purchase his property is the immediate landlord, that is to
say, the person entitled to the receipt of the rent of the
estate; no encumbrancer can avail himself of the privilege,
the reason being that the Bill is intended to assist solvent
landlords, and not to create a new Encumbered Estates
Court. The landlord may sell this privilege, and possibly
by means of this power of sale may be able to put pressure
on his encumbrancers to reduce their claims in order to
obtain immediate payment. The Land Commission, in
their character of quasi-arbitrators between the landlord and
the Irish State Authority, have ample powers given to enable
them to do justice. If the statutory price, as settled according
to the Act, is too low, they may raise it to twenty-two
years' purchase instead of twenty years' purchase. If it is
<!-- Page 105 --><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105" />too high, they may refuse to buy unless the landlord will
reduce it to a proper price. In the congested districts
scheduled in the Bill the land, on a sale, passes to the Irish
State Authority, as landlords, and not to the tenants; the
reason being that it is considered that the tenants would be
worsened, rather than bettered, by having their small plots
vested in them in fee simple. For the same cause it is provided
that in any part of Ireland tenants of holdings under
&pound;4 a year may object to become the owners of their
holdings, which will thereupon vest, on a sale, in the Irish
State Authority. Lastly, the opportunity is taken of
establishing a registry of title in respect of all property
dealt with under the Bill. The result of such a registry
would be that any property entered therein would ever
thereafter be capable of being transferred with the same
facility, and at as little expense, as stock in the public
funds.<!-- Page 106 --><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106" /></p>

<h2><a name="THE_UNIONISTquot_POSITION" id="THE_UNIONISTquot_POSITION" />THE &quot;UNIONIST&quot; POSITION.</h2>

<p class="author">BY CANON MACCOLL</p>


<p>Is it not time that the opponents of Home Rule for Ireland
should define their position? They defeated Mr. Gladstone's
scheme last year in Parliament and in the constituencies;
and they defeated it by the promise of a
counter policy which was to consist, in brief, of placing
Ireland on the same footing as Great Britain in respect to
Local Government; or, if there was to be any difference, it
was to be in the direction of a larger and more generous
measure for Ireland than for the rest of the United Kingdom.
This certainly was the policy propounded by the
distinguished leader of the Liberal Unionists in his speech
at Belfast, in November, 1885, and repeated in his electoral
speeches last year. In the Belfast speech Lord Hartington
said: &quot;My opinion is that it is desirable for Irishmen that
institutions of local self-government such as are possessed
by England and Scotland, and such as we hope to give in
the next session in greater extent to England and Scotland,
should also be extended to Ireland.&quot; But this extension of
local self-government to Ireland would require, in Lord
Hartington's opinion, a fundamental change in the fabric of
Irish Government. &quot;I would not shrink,&quot; he says, &quot;from
a great and bold reconstruction of the Irish Government,&quot;
a reconstruction leading up gradually to some real and
<!-- Page 107 --><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107" />substantial form of Home Rule. His Lordship's words
are: &quot;I submit with some confidence to you these principles,
which I have endeavoured to lay down, and upon
which, I think, the extension of Local Government in
Ireland must proceed. First, you must have some adequate
guarantees both for the maintenance of the essential unity
of the Empire and for the protection of the minority in
Ireland. And, secondly, you must also admit this principle:
the work of complete self-government of Ireland, the
grant of full control over the management of its own affairs,
is not a grant that can be made by any Parliament of this
country in a day. It must be the work of continuous and
careful effort.&quot; Elsewhere in the same speech Lord Hartington
says: &quot;Certainly I am of opinion that nothing can
be done in the direction of giving Ireland anything like
complete control over her own affairs either in a day, or a
session, or probably in a Parliament.&quot; &quot;Complete control
over her own affairs,&quot; &quot;the work of complete self-government
of Ireland, the grant of full control over the management
of its own affairs:&quot; this is the policy which Lord
Hartington proclaimed in Ulster, the promise which he, the
proximate Liberal leader, held out to Ireland on the eve of
the General Election of 1885. It was a policy to be begun
&quot;in the next session,&quot; though not likely to be completed
&quot;in a day, or a session, or probably in a Parliament.&quot;</p>

<p>Next to Mr. Gladstone and Lord Hartington the most
important member of the Liberal party at that time was
undoubtedly Mr. Chamberlain, and Mr. Chamberlain's
Irish policy was proclaimed in the <i>Radical Programme,
</i> which was published before the General Election as the
Radical leader's manifesto to the constituencies. This
scheme, which Mr. Chamberlain had submitted as a
responsible minister to the Cabinet of Mr. Gladstone in
June, 1885, culminated in a National Council which was to
control a series of local bodies and govern the whole of<!-- Page 108 --><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108" />
Ireland. &quot;His National Council was to consist of two
orders; one-third of its members were to be elected by the
owners of property, and two-thirds by ratepayers. The
National Council also was to be a single one, and Ulster
was not to have a separate Council. As the Council was
to be charged with the supervision and legislation about
education, which is the burning question between Catholics
and Protestants, it is clear that Mr. Chamberlain at that
time contemplated no special protection for Ulster.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15" /><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Moreover,
in a letter dated April 23rd, 1886, and published in
the <i>Daily News</i> of May 17th, 1886, Mr. Chamberlain
declared that he &quot;had not changed his opinion in the least&quot;
since his first public declaration on Irish policy in 1874.
&quot;I then said that I was in favour of the principles of Home
Rule, as defined by Mr. Butt, but that I would do nothing
which would weaken in any way Imperial unity, and that I
did not agree with all the details of his plan.... Mr. Butt's
proposals were in the nature of a federal scheme, and differ
entirely from Mr. Gladstone's, which are on the lines of
Colonial independence. Mr. Butt did not propose to give
up Irish representation at Westminster.&quot; It is true that Mr.
Butt did not propose to give up Irish representation at
Westminster; but it is also true that he proposed to give
it up in the sense in which Mr. Chamberlain wishes to
retain it. Mr. Butt's words, in the debate to which Mr.
Chamberlain refers, are, &quot;that the House should meet <i>without
Irish members</i> for the discussion of English and Scotch
business; and when there was any question affecting the
Empire at large, Irish members might be summoned to
attend. He saw no difficulty in the matter.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16" /><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>There is no need to quote Mr. Gladstone's declarations
<!-- Page 109 --><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109" />on the Irish question at the General Election of 1885, and
previously. He has been accused of springing a surprise
on the country when he proposed Home Rule in the
beginning of 1886. That is not, at all events, the opinion
of Lord Hartington. In a speech delivered at the Eighty
Club in March, 1886, his Lordship, with his usual manly
candour, declared as follows: &quot;I am not going to say one
word of complaint or charge against Mr. Gladstone for the
attitude which he has taken on this question. I think no
one who has read or heard, during a long series of years, the
declarations of Mr. Gladstone on the question of self-government
for Ireland, can be surprised at the tone of his
present declarations.... When I look back to those
declarations that Mr. Gladstone made in Parliament,
which have not been unfrequent; when I look back to the
increased definiteness given to those declarations in his
address to the electors of Midlothian, and in his Midlothian
speeches; I say, when I consider all these things,
I feel that I have not, and that no one has, any right to complain
of the tone of the declarations which Mr. Gladstone
has recently made upon this subject.&quot;</p>

<p>So much as to the state of Liberal opinion on the Irish
question at the General Election of 1885. The leaders of
all sections of the party put the Irish question in the foreground
of their programme for the session of 1886. We all
remember Sir Charles Dilke's public announcement that
he and Mr. Chamberlain were going to visit Ireland in the
autumn of 1885, to study the Irish question on the spot,
with a view to maturing a plan for the first session of the
new Parliament.</p>

<p>What about the Conservative party? Lord Salisbury's
Newport speech was avowedly the programme of his Cabinet.
It was the Conservative answer to Mr. Gladstone's Midlothian
manifesto. He dealt with the Irish question in
guarded language; but it was language which plainly showed
<!-- Page 110 --><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110" />that he recognized, not less clearly than the Liberal leaders,
the crucial change which the assimilation of the Irish
franchise to that of Great Britain had wrought in Irish
policy. His keen eye saw at once the important bearing
which that enfranchisement had on the traditional policy of
coercion: &quot;You had passed an Act of Parliament, giving
in unexampled abundance, and with unexampled freedom,
supreme power to the great mass of the Irish people&mdash;supreme
power as regards their own locality.... To my
mind the renewal of exceptional legislation against a population
whom you had treated legislatively to this marked
confidence was so gross in its inconsistency that you could
not possibly hope, during the few remaining months that
were at your disposal before the present Parliament expired,
to renew any legislation which expressed on one side a
distrust of what on the other side your former legislation
had so strongly emphasized. The only result of your doing
it would have been, not that you would have passed the
Act, but that you would have promoted by the very
inconsistency of the position that you were occupying&mdash;by
the untenable character of the arguments that you were
advancing&mdash;you would have produced so intense an exasperation
amongst the Irish people, that you would
have caused ten times more evil, ten times more resistance
to law than your Crimes Act, even if it had
been renewed, would possibly have been able to check.&quot;
Lord Salisbury went on to say that &quot;the effect of the
Crimes Act had been very much exaggerated,&quot; and that
&quot;boycotting is of that character which legislation has very
great difficulty in reaching.&quot; &quot;Boycotting does not operate
through outrage. Boycotting is the act of a large majority
of a community resolving to do a number of things which
are themselves legal, and which are only illegal by the intention
with which they are done.&quot;</p>

<p>Next to Lord Salisbury the most prominent member of
<!-- Page 111 --><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111" />the Conservative party at that date was Lord Randolph
Churchill. On the 3rd of January, 1885, when it was
rumoured that Mr. Gladstone's Government, then in office,
intended to renew a few of the clauses of the Crimes Act,
Lord Randolph Churchill made a speech at Bow against
any such policy. The following quotation will suffice as a
specimen of his opinion: &quot;It comes to this, that the policy
of the Government in Ireland is to declare on the one hand,
by the passing of the Reform Bill, that the Irish people are
perfectly capable of exercising for the advantage of the
Empire the highest rights and privileges of citizenship; and
by the proposal to renew the Crimes Act they simultaneously
declare, on the other hand, that the Irish people
are perfectly incapable of performing for the advantage of
society the lowest and most ordinary duties of citizenship.... All
I can say is that, if such an incoherent, such a
ridiculous, such a dangerously ridiculous combination of
acts can be called a policy, then, thank God, the Conservative
party have no policy.&quot;</p>

<p>Within a few months of the delivery of that speech a
Conservative Government was in office, with Lord Randolph
Churchill as its leader in the House of Commons; and one
of the first acts of the new leader was to separate himself
ostentatiously from the Irish policy of Lord Spencer and
from the policy of coercion in general. Lord Randolph
Churchill, as the organ of the Government in the House of
Commons, repudiated in scornful language any atom of
sympathy with the policy pursued by Lord Spencer in
Ireland; and Lord Carnarvon, the new Viceroy, declared
that &quot;the era of coercion&quot; was past, and that the Conservative
Government intended to govern Ireland by the ordinary
law. Lord Carnarvon, in addition, and very much to his
credit, sought and obtained an interview with Mr. Parnell,
and discussed with him, in sympathetic language, the
question of Home Rule. In his own explanation of this
<!-- Page 112 --><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112" />interview Lord Carnarvon admitted that he desired to see
established in Ireland some form of self-government which
would satisfy &quot;the national sentiment.&quot;</p>

<p>It is idle, therefore, to assert that the question of Home
Rule for Ireland, in some form or other, was sprung on the
country as a surprise by Mr. Gladstone in the beginning of
1886. The question was brought prominently before the
public in the General Election of 1885 as one that must be
faced in the new Parliament. All parties were committed
to that policy, and the only difference was as to the character
and limits of the measure of self-government to be granted
to Ireland; whether it was to be large enough to satisfy
&quot;the national sentiment,&quot; as Lord Carnarvon, Mr. Chamberlain,
Mr. Gladstone, and others desired; or whether it was to
consist only of a system of county boards under the control of
a reformed Dublin Castle. There was a general agreement
that the grant to Ireland of electoral equality with England
necessitated equality of political treatment, and that, above
all things, there was to be no renewal of the stale policy of
Coercion until the Irish people had got an opportunity of
proving or disproving their fitness for self-government,
unless, indeed, there should happen to be a recrudescence
of crime which would render exceptional legislation necessary.
The election of 1886 turned almost entirely on the
question of Irish government, and it is not too much to say
that Conservatives and Liberal Unionists vied with Home
Rulers in repudiating a return to the policy of coercion until
the effect of some kind of self-government had been tried.
Of course, there were the usual platitudes about the necessity
of maintaining law and order; but there was a <i>consensus</i> of
profession that coercion should not be resorted to unless
there was a fresh outbreak of crime and disorder in Ireland.</p>

<p>Such were the professions of the opponents of Home
Rule in 1885 and in 1886. They have now been in office
for eighteen months, and what do we behold? They have
<!-- Page 113 --><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113" />passed a perpetual Coercion Bill for Ireland, and the question
of any kind of self-government has been relegated to an
uncertain future. In his recent speech at Birmingham
(Sept. 29), Mr. Chamberlain has declared that the question
is not ripe for solution, and that the question of disestablishment,
in Wales, Scotland, and England successively, as
well as the questions of Local Option, local government for
Great Britain, and of the safety of life at sea, must take
precedence of it. That means the postponement of the
reform of Irish Government to the Greek Kalends. What
justification can be made for this change of front? No
valid justification has been offered. So far from there
having been any increase of crime in the interval, there
has been a very marked decrease. When the Coercion
Bill received the royal assent last August, Ireland was more
free from crime than it had been for many years past.
Nothing had happened to account for the return to the
policy of coercion in violation of the promise to try the
experiment of conciliation. The National League was
in full vigour in 1885-1886, when the policy of coercion
was abandoned; boycotting was just as prevalent, and
outrages were much more numerous.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances it is the opponents of Home
Rule, not its advocates, who owe an explanation to the
public. They defeated Mr. Gladstone's Bill, but promised
a Bill of their own. Where is their Bill? We hear nothing
of it. They have made a complete change of front. They
now tell us that the grievance of Ireland is entirely economic,
and that the true solution of the Irish question is the abolition
of dual ownership in land combined with a firm administration
of the existing law. England and Scotland are to have
a large measure of local government next year; but Ireland
is to wait till a more convenient season. A more complete
reversal of the policy proclaimed last summer by the so-called
Unionists cannot be imagined.</p>

<p><!-- Page 114 --><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114" />Still, however, the &quot;Unionists&quot; hope to be able some
day to offer some form of self-government to Ireland. For
party purposes they are wise in postponing that day to the
latest possible period, for its advent will probably dissolve
the union of the &quot;Unionists.&quot; Lord Salisbury, Lord
Hartington, Mr. Bright, and Mr. Chamberlain cannot
agree upon any scheme which all can accept without a
public recantation of previous professions. Mr. Bright is
opposed to Home Rule &quot;in any shape or form.&quot; Mr.
Chamberlain, on the other hand, is in favour of a great
National Council, on Mr. Butt's lines or on the lines
of the Canadian plan; either of which would give the
National Council control over education and the maintenance
of law and order. Latterly, indeed, Mr. Chamberlain
has advocated a separate treatment for Ulster. But
the first act of an Ulster Provincial Assembly would probably
be to declare the union of that Province with the rest
of Ireland. Ulster, be it remembered, returns a majority
of Nationalists to the Imperial Parliament. To exclude
Ulster from any share in the settlement offered to the other
three Provinces would therefore be impracticable; and
Mr. Bright has lately expressed his opinion emphatically in
that sense. In any case, Lord Hartington could be no party
to any scheme so advanced as Mr. Chamberlain's. For
although he declared, in his Belfast speech, that &quot;complete
self-government&quot; was the goal of his policy for Ireland, he
was careful to explain that &quot;the extension of Irish management
over Irish affairs must be a growth from small beginnings.&quot;
But this &quot;growth from small beginnings&quot; would
be, in Lord Salisbury's opinion, a very dangerous and mischievous
policy. The establishment of self-government
in Ireland, as distinct from what is commonly known
as Home Rule, he pronounced in his Newport speech to
be &quot;a very difficult question;&quot; and in the following passage
he placed his finger upon the kernel of the difficulty:&mdash;<!-- Page 115 --><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115" />
&quot;A local authority is more exposed to the temptation,
and has more of the facility for enabling a majority to be
unjust to the minority, than is the case when the authority
derives its sanction and extends its jurisdiction over a wide
area. That is one of the weaknesses of local authorities.
In a large central authority the wisdom of several parts of
the country will correct the folly or the mistakes of one. In
a local authority that correction to a much greater extent
is wanting; and it would be impossible to leave that out
of sight in the extension of any such local authority to
Ireland.&quot;</p>

<p>This seems to me a much wiser and more statesmanlike
view than a system of elective boards scattered broadcast
over Ireland. A multitude of local boards all over Ireland,
without a recognized central authority to control them,
would inevitably become facile instruments in the hands
of the emissaries of disorder and sedition. And, even apart
from any such sinister influences, they would be almost
certain to yield to the temptation of being oppressive,
extravagant, and corrupt, if there were no executive power
to command their confidence and enforce obedience.
Without the previous creation of some authority of that
kind it would be sheer madness to offer Ireland the fatal
boon of local self-government. It would enormously
increase without conciliating the power of the Nationalists,
and would make the administration of Ireland by constitutional
means simply impossible. The policy of the Liberal
Unionists is thus much too large or much too small. It is
too small to conciliate, and therefore too large to be given
with safety. All these proposed concessions are liable to
one insuperable objection; they would each and all enable
the Irish to extort Home Rule, but under circumstances
which would rob it of its grace and repel gratitude. Mill
has some admirable observations bearing on this subject,
and I venture to quote the following passage: &quot;The
<!-- Page 116 --><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116" />greatest imperfection of popular local institutions, and
the chief cause of the failure which so often attends them,
is the low calibre of the men by whom they are almost
always carried on. That these should be of a very miscellaneous
character is, indeed, part of the usefulness of the
institution; it is that circumstance chiefly which renders
it a school of political capacity and general intelligence.
But a school supposes teachers as well as scholars; the
utility of the instruction greatly depends on its bringing
inferior minds into contact with superior, a contact which
in the ordinary course of life is altogether exceptional, and
the want of which contributes more than anything else to
keep the generality of mankind on one level of contented
ignorance.... It is quite hopeless to induce persons of a
high class, either socially or intellectually, to take a share of
local administration in a corner by piecemeal as members
of a Paving Board or a Drainage Commission.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17" /><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Mill goes on to argue that it is essential to the safe
working of any scheme of local self-government that it
should be under the control of a central authority in
harmony with public opinion.</p>

<p>When the &quot;Unionists&quot; begin, if they ever do begin,
seriously to deliberate on the question of self-government
for Ireland, they will find that they have only two practicable
alternatives&mdash;the maintenance of the present system, or
some scheme of Home Rule on the lines of Mr. Gladstone's
much misunderstood Bill. And the ablest men among the
&quot;Unionists&quot; are beginning to perceive this. The <i>Spectator</i>
has in a recent article implored Mr. Chamberlain to desist
from any further proposal in favour of self-government for
Ireland, because the inevitable result would be to split up
the Unionist party; and Mr. Chamberlain, as we have seen,
has accepted the advice. Another very able and very
logical opponent of Home Rule has candidly avowed that
<!-- Page 117 --><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117" />the only alternative to Home Rule is the perpetuation of
&quot;things as they are.&quot; Ireland, he thinks, &quot;possesses none
of the conditions necessary for local self-government.&quot;
His own view, therefore, is &quot;that in Ireland, as in France,
an honest, centralized administration of impartial officials,
and not local self-government, would best meet the real
wants of the people.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The name of 'Self-government' has a natural fascination
for Englishmen; but a policy which cannot satisfy the
wishes of Home Rulers, which may&mdash;it is likely enough&mdash;be
of no benefit to the Irish people, which will certainly
weaken the Government in its contest with lawlessness and
oppression, is not a policy which obviously commends itself
to English good sense.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18" /><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Well may this distinguished &quot;Supporter of things as they
are&quot; declare: &quot;The maintenance of the Union [on such
terms] must necessarily turn out as severe a task as ever
taxed a nation's energies; for to maintain the Union with
any good effect, means that, while refusing to accede to
the wishes of millions of Irishmen, we must sedulously do
justice to every fair demand from Ireland; must strenuously,
and without fear or favour, assert the equal rights of landlords
and tenants, of Protestants and Catholics; and must,
at the same time, put down every outrage and reform every
abuse.&quot;</p>

<p>What hope is there of this? Our only guide to the
probabilities of the future is our experience of the past
And what has that been in Ireland? In every year since
the Legislative Union there have been multitudes of men
in England as upright, as enlightened, as well-intentioned
towards Ireland, as Professor Dicey, and with better
opportunities of translating their thoughts into acts. Yet
what has been the result? <i>Si monumenlum requiris circum<!-- Page 118 --><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118" />spice</i>.
Behold Ireland at this moment, and examine every
year of its history since the Union. Do the annals of any
constitutional Government in the world present so portentous
a monument of Parliamentary failure, so vivid an
example of a moral and material ruin &quot;paved with good
intentions&quot;? Therein lies the pathos of it. Not from
malice, not from cruelty, not from wanton injustice, not
even from callous indifference to suffering and wrong, does
our misgovernment of Ireland come. If the evil had its
root in deliberate wrong-doing on the part of England it
would probably have been cured long ago. But each
generation, while freely confessing the sins of its fathers,
has protested its own innocence and boasted of its own
achievements, and then, with a pharisaic sense of rectitude,
has complacently pointed to some inscrutable flaw in the
Irish character as the key to the Irish problem. The
generation which passed the Act of Union, oblivious of
British pledges solemnly given and lightly broken, wondered
what had become of the prosperity and contentment which
the promoters of the Union had promised to Ireland. The
next generation made vicarious penance, and preferred the
enactment of Catholic emancipation to the alternative of
civil war; and then wondered in its turn that Ireland still
remained unpacified. Then came a terrible famine, followed
by evictions on a scale so vast and cruel that the late Sir
Robert Peel declared that no parallel could be found for
such a tale of inhumanity in &quot;the records of any country,
civilized or barbarous.&quot; Another generation, pluming itself
on its enlightened views and kind intentions, passed the
Encumbered Estates Act, which delivered the Irish tenants
over to the tender mercies of speculators and money-lenders;
and then Parliament for a time closed its eyes and ears, and
relied upon force alone to keep Ireland quiet. It rejected
every suggestion of reform in the Land laws; and a great
Minister, himself an Irish landlord, dismissed the whole
<!-- Page 119 --><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119" />subject in the flippant epigram that &quot;tenant-right was landlord-wrong.&quot;
Since then the Irish Church has been disestablished,
and two Land Acts have been passed; yet we
seem to be as far as ever from the pacification of Ireland.
Surely it is time to inquire whether the evil is not inherent
in our system of governing Ireland, and whether there is
any other cure than that which De Beaumont suggested,
namely, the destruction of the system. It is probable that
there is not in all London a more humane or a more kind-hearted
man than Lord Salisbury. Yet Lord Salisbury's
Government will do some harsh and inequitable things in
Ireland this winter, just as Liberal Governments have done
during their term of office. The fault is not in the men, but
in the system which they have to administer. I see no
reason to doubt that Sir M. Hicks-Beach did the best he
could under the circumstances; but, unfortunately, bad is
the best. In a conversation which I had with Dr. D&ouml;llinger
while he was in full communion with his Church, I ventured
to ask him whether he thought that a new Pope, of Liberal
ideas, force of character, and commanding ability, would
make any great difference in the Papal system. &quot;No,&quot; he
replied, &quot;the Curial system is the growth of centuries, and
there can be no change of any consequence while it lasts.
Many a Pope has begun with brave projects of reform; but
the struggle has been brief, and the end has been invariably
the same: the Pope has been forced to succumb. His
<i>entourage</i> has been too much for him. He has found himself
enclosed in a system which was too strong for him,
wheel within wheel; and while the system lasts the most
enlightened ideas and the best intentions are in the long
run unavailing.&quot; This criticism applies, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>,
to what may be called the Curial system of Dublin Castle.
It is a species of political Ultramontanism, exercising
supreme power behind the screen of an official infallibility
on which there is practically no check, since Parliament has
<!-- Page 120 --><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120" />never hitherto refused to grant it any power which it demanded
for enforcing its decrees.</p>

<p>There is, moreover, another consideration which must
convince any dispassionate mind which ponders it, that the
British Parliament is incompetent to manage Irish affairs,
and must become increasingly incompetent year by year.
In ordinary circumstances Parliament sits about twenty-seven
weeks out of the fifty-two. Five out of the twenty-seven
may safely be subtracted for holidays, debates on the
Address, and other debates apart from ordinary business.
That leaves twenty-two weeks, and out of these two nights
a week are at the disposal of the Government and three at
the disposal of private members; leaving in all forty-four
days for the Government and sixty-six for private members.
Into those forty-four nights Government must compress all
its yearly programme of legislation for the whole of the
British Empire, from the settlement of some petty dispute
about land in the Hebrides, to some question of high
policy in Egypt, India, or other portions of the Queen's
world-wide empire; and all this amidst endless distractions,
enforced attendance through dreary debates and vapid talk,
and a running fire of cross-examination from any volunteer
questioner out of the six hundred odd members who sit
outside the Government circle. The consequence is, that
Parliament is getting less able every year to overtake the
mass of business which comes before it. Each year contributes
its quota of inevitable arrears to the accumulated
mass of previous Sessions, and the process will go on multiplying
in increasing ratio as the complex and multiform
needs of modern life increase. The large addition recently
made to the electorate of the United Kingdom is already
forcing a crop of fresh subjects on the attention of Parliament,
as well as presenting old ones from new points of
view. Plans of devolution and Grand Committees will fail
to cope with this evil. To overcome it we need some
<!-- Page 121 --><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121" />organic change in our present Parliamentary system, some
form of decentralization, which shall leave the Imperial
Parliament supreme over all subordinate bodies, yet relegate
to the historic and geographical divisions of the United
Kingdom the management severally of their own local
affairs.</p>

<p>I should have better hope from governing Ireland (if it
were possible) as we govern India, than from the present
Unionist method of leaving &quot;things as they are.&quot; A Viceroy
surrounded by a Council of trained officials, and in semi-independence
of Parliament, would have settled the Irish
question, land and all, long ago. But imagine India
governed on the model of Ireland: the Viceroy and the
most important member of his Government changing with
every change of Administration at Westminster;<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19" /><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> his
Council and the official class in general consisting almost
exclusively of native Mussulmans, deeply prejudiced by
religious and traditional enmity against the great mass of
the population; himself generally subordinate to his Chief
Secretary, and exposed to the daily criticism of an ignorant
Parliament and to the determined hostility of eighty-six
Hindoos, holding seats in Parliament as the representatives
of the vast majority of the people of India, and resenting
bitterly the domination of the hereditary oppressors of their
race. How long could the Government of India be carried
on under such conditions?</p>

<p>Viewing it all round, then, it must be admitted that the
problem of governing Ireland while leaving things as they are
<!-- Page 122 --><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122" />is a sufficiently formidable one. Read the remarkable admissions
which the facts have forced from intelligent opponents
of Home Rule like Mr. Dicey, and add to them all the other
evils which are rooted in our existing system of Irish government,
and then consider what hope there is, under &quot;things
as they are,&quot; of &quot;sedulously doing justice to every demand
from Ireland,&quot; &quot;strenuously, and without fear or favour,
asserting the equal rights of landlords and tenants, Protestants
and Catholics,&quot; &quot;putting down every outrage, and
reforming every abuse;&quot; and all the &quot;while refusing to
accede to the wishes of millions of Irishmen&quot; for a fundamental
change in a political arrangement that has for
centuries produced all the mischief which the so-called
Unionist party are forced to admit, and much more besides,
while it has at the same time frustrated every serious endeavour
to bring about the better state of things which they
expect from&mdash;what? From &quot;things as they are!&quot; As well
expect grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles. While the
tree remains the same, no amount of weeding, or pruning,
or manuring, or change of culture, will make it bring forth
different fruit. Mr. Dicey, among others, has demolished
what Lord Beaconsfield used to call the &quot;bit-by-bit&quot; reformers
of Irish Government&mdash;those who would administer
homoeopathic doses of local self-government, but always
under protest that the supply was to stop short of what
would satisfy the hunger of the patient. But a continuance
of &quot;things as they are,&quot; gilded with a thin tissue of benevolent
hopes and aspirations, is scarcely a more promising
remedy for the ills of Ireland. Is it not time to try some
new treatment&mdash;one which has been tried in similar cases,
and always with success? One only policy has never been
tried in Ireland&mdash;honest Home Rule.</p>

<p>Certainly, if Home Rule is to be refused till all the
prophets of evil are refuted, Ireland must go without Home
Rule for ever. &quot;If the sky fall, we shall catch larks.&quot; But
<!-- Page 123 --><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123" />he would be a foolish bird-catcher who waited for that
contingency. And not less foolish is the statesman who
sits still till every conceivable objection to his policy has
been mathematically refuted in advance, and every wild
prediction falsified by the event; for that would ensure
his never moving at all. <i>Sedet &aelig;ternumque sedebit</i>. A
proper enough attitude, perhaps, on the part of an eristic
philosopher speculating on politics in the silent shade of
academic groves, but hardly suitable for a practical politician
who has to take action on one of the most burning questions
of our time. Human affairs are not governed by mathematical
reasoning. You cannot demonstrate the precise
results of any legislative measure beforehand as you can
demonstrate the course of a planet in the solar system.
&quot;Probability,&quot; as Bishop Butler says, &quot;is the guide of life;&quot;
and an older philosopher than Butler has warned us that
to demand demonstrative proof in the sphere of contingent
matter is the same kind of absurdity as to demand probable
reasoning in mathematics. You cannot confute a prophet
before the event; you can only disbelieve him. The
advocates of Home Rule believe that their policy would
in general have an exactly contrary effect to that predicted
by their opponents. In truth, every act of legislation is,
before experience, amenable to such destructive criticism
as these critics urge against Home Rule. I have not a
doubt that they could have made out an unanswerable
&quot;case&quot; against the Great Charter at Runnymede; and they
would find it easy to prove on <i>&agrave; priori</i> grounds that the
British Constitution is one of the most absurd, mischievous,
and unworkable instruments that ever issued from human
brains or from the evolution of events. By their method
of reasoning the Great Charter and other fundamental
portions of the Constitution ought to have brought the
Government of the British Empire to a deadlock long ago.
Every suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act, every Act of<!-- Page 124 --><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124" />
Attainder, every statute for summary trial and conviction
before justices of the peace, is a violation of the fundamental
article of the Constitution, which requires that no
man shall be imprisoned or otherwise punished except after
lawful trial by his peers.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20" /><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Consider also the magazines of
explosive materials which lie hidden in the constitutional
prerogatives of the Crown, if they could only be ignited by
the match of an ingenious theorist. The Crown, as Lord
Sherbrooke once somewhat irreverently expressed it, &quot;can
turn every cobbler in the land into a peer,&quot; and could thus
put an end, as the Duke of Wellington declared, to &quot;the
Constitution of this country.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21" /><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> &quot;The Crown is not bound
by Act of Parliament unless named therein by special and
particular words.&quot;[22] The Crown can make peace or war
without consulting Parliament, can by secret treaty saddle
the nation with the most perilous obligations, and give
away all such portions of the empire as do not rest on
Statute. The prerogative of mercy, too, would enable an
eccentric Sovereign, aided by an obsequious Minister, to
open the jails and let all the convicted criminals in the land
loose upon society.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22" /><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> But criticism which proves too much
in effect proves nothing.</p>

<p>In short, every stage in the progress of constitutional
reform has, in matter of fact, been marked by similar predictions
falsified by results, and the prophets who condemn
Home Rule have no better credentials; indeed, much
worse, for they proclaim the miserable failure of &quot;things
as they are,&quot; whereas their predecessors were in their day
satisfied with things as they were.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23" /><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a><!-- Page 125 --><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125" /></p>

<p>It is, high time, therefore, to call upon the opponents
of Home Rule to tell us plainly where they stand. They
<!-- Page 126 --><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126" />claim a mandate from the country for their policy. They
neither asked nor received a mandate to support the
system of Government which prevailed in Ireland at the
last election, and still less the policy of coercion which they
have substituted for that system. Do they mean to go back
or forward? They cannot stand still. They have already
discovered that one act of repression leads to another, and
they will find ere long that they have no alternative except
Home Rule or the suppression of Parliamentary Government
in Ireland. Men may talk lightly of the ease with
which eighty-six Irish members may be kept in order in
Parliament. They forget that the Irish people are behind
the Irish members. How is Ireland to be governed on
Parliamentary principles if the voice of her representatives
is to be forcibly silenced or disregarded? Could even
Yorkshire or Lancashire be governed permanently in that
way? Let it be observed that we have now reached this
pass, namely, that the opponents of Home Rule are opposed
to the Irish members, not on any particular form of self-government
for Ireland, but on any form; in other words,
<!-- Page 127 --><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127" />they resist the all but unanimous demand of Ireland for
what &quot;Unionists&quot; of all parties declared a year ago to be
a reasonable demand. No candidate at the last election
ventured to ask the suffrages of any constituency as &quot;a supporter
of things as they are.&quot; Yet that is practically the
attitude now assumed by the Ministerial party, both Conservatives
and Liberal Unionists. It is an attitude of which
the country is getting weary, as the bye-elections have
shown. But the &quot;Unionists,&quot; it must be admitted, are in
a sore dilemma. Their strength, such as it is, lies in doing
nothing for the reform of Irish Government. Their bond
of union consists of nothing else but opposition to Mr.
Gladstone's policy. They dare not attempt to formulate
any policy of their own, knowing well that they would go
to pieces in the process. Their hope and speculation is
that something may happen to remove Mr. Gladstone from
the political arena before the next dissolution. But, after
all, Mr. Gladstone did not create the Irish difficulty. It
preceded him and will survive him, unless it is settled to
the satisfaction of the Irish people before his departure.
And the difficulty of the final settlement will increase with
every year of delay. Nor will the difficulty be confined
to Ireland. The Irish question is already reacting upon
kindred, though not identical, problems in England and
Scotland, and the longer it is kept open, so much the worse
will it be for what are generally regarded as Conservative
interests. It is not the Moderate Liberals or Conservatives
who are gaining ground by the prolongation of the controversy,
and the disappearance of Mr. Gladstone from the
scene would have the effect of removing from the forces of
extreme Radicalism a conservative influence, which his
political opponents will discover when it is too late to
restore it. Their regret will then be as unavailing as the
lament of William of Deloraine over his fallen foe&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;I'd give the lands of Deloraine<br /></span>
<span>Dark Musgrave were alive again.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><!-- Page 128 --><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128" />The Irish landlords have already begun to realize the
mistake they made when they rejected Mr. Gladstone's
policy of Home Rule and Land Purchase. It is the old
story of the Sibyl's books. No British Government will
ever again offer such terms to the Irish landlords as they
refused to accept from Mr. Gladstone. On the other hand,
Home Rule is inevitable. Can any reflective person really
suppose that the democracy of Great Britain will consent
to refuse to share with the Irish people the boon of self-government
which will be offered to themselves next year?
Any attempt to exclude the Irish from the benefits of such a
scheme, after all the promises of the last general election,
would almost certainly wreck the government; for constituencies
have ways and means of impressing their wills on
their representatives in Parliament even without a dissolution.
If, on the other hand, Ireland should be included in a general
scheme of local Government, the question of who shall
control the police will arise. In Great Britain the police,
of course, will be under local control. To refuse this to
Ireland would be to offer a boon with a stigma attached
to it. The Irish members agreed to let the control of the
constabulary remain, under Mr. Gladstone's scheme, for some
years in the hands of the British Government; but they would
not agree to this while Dublin Castle ruled the country.
Moreover, the formidable difficulty suggested by Lord Salisbury
and Mr. John Stuart Mill (see pp. 115, 116) would appear
the moment men began seriously to consider the question of
local government for Ireland. The government of Dublin
Castle would have to go, but something would have to be put
in its place; and when that point has been reached it will
probably be seen that nothing much better or safer can be
found than some plan on the main lines of Mr. Gladstone's
Bill.<!-- Page 129 --><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129" /></p>

suffice. &quot;It was natural,&quot; says Mill (<i>Rep. Gov.</i>, p. 311), &quot;to feel
strong doubts before trial had been made how such a provision [as the
Supreme Court of the United States] would work; whether the tribunal
would have the courage to exercise its constitutional power; if it did,
whether it would exercise it wisely, and whether the Government would
consent peaceably to its decision. The discussions on the American
Constitution, before its final adoption, give evidence that these natural
apprehensions were strongly felt; but they are now entirely quieted,
since, during the two generations and more which have subsequently
elapsed, nothing has occurred to verify them, though there have at
times been disputes of considerable acrimony, and which became the
badges of parties respecting the limits of the authority of the Federal
and State Governments.&quot; The Austrian opponents of Home Rule in
Hungary predicted that it would lead straight to separation. The
opponents of the Canadian Constitution prophesied that Canada would
in a few years be annexed to the United States; and Home Rule in
Australia was believed by able statesmen to involve independence at an
early date. Mr. Dicey himself tells us &quot;that the wisest thinkers of the
eighteenth century (including Burke) held that the independence of the
American Colonies meant the irreparable ruin of Great Britain. There
were apparently solid reasons for this belief: experience has proved
it to be without foundation.&quot; The various changes in our own Constitution,
and even in our Criminal Code, were believed by &quot;men of light
and leading&quot; at the time to portend national ruin. All the judges in
the land, all the bankers, and the professions generally, petitioned
against alteration in the law which sent children of ten to the gallows
for the theft of a pocket-handkerchief. The great Lord Ellenborough
declared in the House of Lords that &quot;the learned judges were unanimously
agreed&quot; that any mitigation in that law would imperil &quot;the
public security.&quot; &quot;My Lords,&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;if we suffer this Bill
to pass we shall not know where we stand; we shall not know whether
we are on our heads or on our feet.&quot; Mr. Perceval, when leader of the
House of Commons in 1807, declared that &quot;he could not conceive a
time or change of circumstances which would render further concessions
to the Catholics consistent with the safety of the State.&quot; (<i>Croker
Papers</i>, i. 12.) Croker was a very astute man; but here is his forecast
of the Reform Act of 1832: &quot;No kings, no lords, no inequalities in the
social system; all will be levelled to the plane of the petty shopkeepers
and small farmers: this, perhaps, not without bloodshed, but certainly
by confiscations and persecutions.&quot; &quot;There can be no longer any
doubt that the Reform Bill is a stepping-stone in England to a Republic,
and in Ireland to separation.&quot; Croker met the Queen in 1832, considered
her very good-looking, but thought it not unlikely that &quot;she
may live to be plain Miss Guelph.&quot; Even Sir Robert Peel wrote: &quot;If
I am to be believed, I foresee revolution as the consequence of this
Bill;&quot; and he &quot;felt that it had ceased to be an object of ambition to
any man of equable and consistent mind to enter into the service of the
Crown.&quot; And as late as 1839, so robust a character as Sir James
Graham thought the world was coming to an end because the young
Queen gave her confidence to a Whig Minister. &quot;I begin to share all
your apprehensions and forebodings,&quot; he writes to Croker, &quot;with regard
to the probable issue of the present struggle. The Crown in alliance
with Democracy baffles every calculation on the balance of power in our
mixed form of Government. Aristocracy and Church cannot contend
against Queen and people mixed; they must yield in the first instance,
when the Crown, unprotected, will meet its fate, and the accustomed
round of anarchy and despotism will run its course.&quot; And he prays
that he may &quot;lie cold before that dreadful day.&quot; (<i>Ibid.</i>, ii. 113, 140,
176, 181, 356.) Free Trade created a similar panic. &quot;Good God!&quot;
Croker exclaimed, &quot;what a chaos of anarchy and misery do I foresee
in every direction, from so comparatively small a beginning as changing
an <i>average</i> duty of 8<i>s.</i> into a <i>fixed</i> duty of 8<i>s.</i>, the fact being that the
fixed duty means <i>no duty at all</i>; and <i>no duty at all</i> will be the overthrow
of the existing social and political system of our country!&quot; (<i>Ibid.</i>,
iii. 13.) And what have become of Mr. Lowe's gloomy vaticinations
as to the terrible consequences of the very moderate Reform Bill of
1866, followed as it was by a much more democratic measure?</p></div>

<h2><a name="A_LAWYERS_OBJECTIONS_TO" id="A_LAWYERS_OBJECTIONS_TO" />A LAWYER'S OBJECTIONS TO
HOME RULE.</h2>

<p class="author">BY E.L. GODKIN.</p>


<p>Mr. Dicey in his <i>Case against Home Rule</i> does me the
honour to refer to an article which I wrote a year ago
on &quot;American Home Rule,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24" /><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> expressing in one place
&quot;disagreement in the general conclusion to which the
article is intended to lead,&quot; and in another &quot;inability to
follow the inference&quot; which he supposes me to draw
&quot;against all attempts to enforce an unpopular law.&quot; Now
the object of that article, I may be permitted to explain,
was twofold. I desired, in the first place, to combat the
notion which, it seemed to me, if I might judge from a great
many of the speeches and articles on the Irish question,
was widely diffused even among thoughtful Englishmen that
the manner in which the Irish have expressed their discontent&mdash;that
is, through outrage and disorder&mdash;was indicative
of incapacity for self-government, and even imposed
upon the Englishmen the duty, in the interest of morality
(I think it was the <i>Spectator</i> who took this view), and as
a disciplinary measure, of refusing to such a people the
privilege of managing their own affairs. I tried to show by
several noted examples occurring in this country that
prolonged displays of lawlessness, and violence, and even
<!-- Page 130 --><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130" />cruelty, such as the anti-rent movement in the State of New
York, the Ku-Klux outrages in the South, and the persecution
of Miss Prudence Crandall in Connecticut, were not inconsistent
with the possession of marked political capacity.
I suggested that it was hardly adult politics to take such
things into consideration in passing on the expediency of
conceding local self-government to a subject community.
There was to me something almost childish in the arguments
drawn from Irish lawlessness in the discussion of Home
Rule, and in the moral importance attached by some
Englishmen to the refusal to such wicked men as the Irish
of the things they most desire. It is only in kindergartens,
I said, that rulers are able to do equal and exact justice,
and see that the naughty are brought to grief and the good
made comfortable. Statesmen occupy themselves with the
more serious business of curing discontent. They concern
themselves but little, if at all, with the question whether it
might not be manifested by less objectionable methods.</p>

<p>The Irish methods of manifesting it, I endeavoured to
show, were not exceptional, and did not prove either
inability to make laws or unwillingness to obey them.
I illustrated this by examples drawn from the United States.
I might, had I had more time and space, have made these
examples still more numerous and striking. I might have
given very good reasons for believing that, were Ireland
a state in the American Union, there probably would not
have been any rent paid in the island within the last fifty
years, and that the armed resistance of the tenants would
have had the open or secret sympathy of the great bulk of
the American people. In truth, the importance of Irish
crime as a political symptom is grossly exaggerated by
English writers. I venture to assert that more murders
unconnected with robbery are committed in the State of
Kentucky in one year than in Ireland in ten, and the
condition of some other Southern and Western States is
<!-- Page 131 --><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131" />nearly as bad. All good Americans lament this and are
ashamed of it, but it never enters into the heads of even the
most lugubrious American moralists that Kentucky or any
other State should be disfranchised and remanded to the
condition of a Territory, because the offences against the
person committed in it are so numerous, and the punishment
of them, owing to popular sympathy or apathy, so difficult.</p>

<p>There are a great many Englishmen who think that
when they show that Grattan's Parliament was a venal and
somewhat disorderly body, which occasionally indulged in
mixed metaphor, they have proved the impossibility of giving
Ireland a Parliament now. But then, as they are obliged
to admit, Walpole's Parliament was very corrupt, and no
one would say that for that reason it would have been wise
to suspend constitutional government in England in the
eighteenth century. It is only through the pernicious habit
of thinking of Irishmen as exceptions to all political rules
that Grattan's Parliament is considered likely, had it lasted,
to have come down to our time unreformed and unimproved.</p>

<p>Those have misunderstood me who suppose that I
draw from the success of the anti-rent movement in this
State between 1839 and 1846 an inference against &quot;all
attempts to enforce an unpopular law.&quot; Such was not by
any means my object. What I sought to show by the
history of this movement was that there was nothing peculiar
or inexplicable in the hostility to rent-paying in Ireland.
The rights of the New York landlords were as good in law
and morals as the rights of the Irish landlords, and their
mode of asserting them far superior. Moreover, those who
resisted them were not men of a different race, religion, or
nationality, and had, as Mr. Dicey says, &quot;none of the
excuses that can be urged in extenuation of half-starved
tenants.&quot; Their mode of setting the law at defiance was
exactly similar to that adopted by the Irish, and it was
<!-- Page 132 --><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132" />persisted in for a period of ten years, or until they had
secured a substantial victory. The history of the anti-rent
agitation in New York also illustrates strikingly, as it seems
to me, the perspicacity of a remark made, in substance, long
ago by Mr. Disraeli, which, in my eyes at least, threw a great
deal of light on the Irish problem, namely, that Ireland was
suffering from suppressed revolution. As Mr. Dicey says,
&quot;The crises called revolutions are the ultimate and desperate
cures for the fundamental disorganization of society.
The issue of a revolutionary struggle shows what is the
true sovereign power in the revolutionized state. So
strong is the interest of mankind, at least in any European
country, in favour of some sort of settled rule, that civil
disturbance will, if left to itself, in general end in the
supremacy of some power which by securing the safety at
last gains the attachment of the people. The Reign of
Terror begets the Empire; even wars of religion at last
produce peace, albeit peace may be nothing better than the
iron uniformity of despotism. Could Ireland have been
left for any lengthened period to herself, some form of rule
adapted to the needs of the country would in all probability
have been established. Whether Protestants or Catholics
would have been the predominant element in the State;
whether the landlords would have held their own, or whether
the English system of tenure would long ago have made
way for one more in conformity with native traditions;
whether hostile classes and races would at last have
established some <i>modus vivendi</i> favourable to individual
freedom, or whether despotism under some of its various
forms would have been sanctioned by the acquiescence of
its subjects, are matters of uncertain speculation. A conclusion
which, though speculative, is far less uncertain, is
that Ireland, if left absolutely to herself, would have arrived,
like every other country, at some lasting settlement of her
difficulties&quot; (p. 87). That is to say, that in Ireland as in<!-- Page 133 --><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133" />
New York the attempt to enforce unpopular land laws
would have been abandoned, had local self-government
existed. For &quot;revolution&quot; is, after all, only a fine name
for the failure or refusal of the rulers of a country to persist
in executing laws which the bulk of the population find
obnoxious. When the popular hostility to the law is strong
enough to make its execution impossible, as it was in New
York in the rent affair, it is accepted as the respectable
solution of a very troublesome problem. When, as in
Ireland, it is strong enough to produce turbulence and
disorder, but not strong enough to tire out and overcome
the authorities, it simply ruins the political manners of the
people. If the Irish landlords had had from the beginning
to face the tenants single-handed and either hold them
down by superior physical force, or come to terms with
them as the New York landlords had to do, conditions of
peace and good will would have assuredly been discovered
long ago. The land question, in other words, would have
been adjusted in accordance with &quot;Irish ideas,&quot; that is,
in some way satisfactory to the tenants. The very memory
of the conflict would probably by this time have died out,
and the two classes would be living in harmony on the
common soil. If in New York, on the other hand, the
Van Rensselaers and Livingstons had been able to secure
the aid of martial law and of the Federal troops in asserting
their claims, and in preventing local opinion having any
influence whatever on the settlement of the dispute, there
can be no doubt that a large portion of this State would
to-day be as poor and as savage, and apparently as little
fitted for the serious business of government, as the greater
part of Ireland is.</p>

<p>There is, in truth, no reason to doubt that the idea of
property in land, thoroughly accepted though it be in the
United States, is nevertheless held under the same limitations
as in the rest of the world. No matter what the law
<!-- Page 134 --><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134" />may say in any country, in no country is the right of the
landed proprietor in his acres as absolute as his right in his
movables. A man may own as much land as he can purchase,
and may assert his ownership in its most absolute form
against one, two, or three occupants, but the minute he began
to assert it against a large number of occupants, that is, to
act as if his rights were such that he had only to buy a whole
state or a whole island in order to be able to evict the entire
population, he would find in America, as he finds in Ireland,
that he cannot have the same title to land as to personal property.
He would, for instance, if he tried to oust the people of
a whole district or of a village from their homes on any plea
of possession, or of a contract, find that he was going too
far, and that no matter what the judges might say, or the
sheriff might try to do for him, his legal position was worth
very little to him. Consequently a large landlord in America,
if he were lucky enough to get tenants at all, would be very
chary indeed about quarrelling with more than one of them
at a time. The tenants would no more submit to wholesale
ejectment than the farmers in Missouri would submit some
years ago to a tax levy on their property to pay county bonds
given in aid of a railroad. The goods of some of them were
seized, but a large body of them attended the sale armed
with rifles, having previously issued a notice that the place
would be very &quot;unhealthy&quot; for outside bidders.</p>

<p>The bearing of this condition of American opinion on
the Irish question will be plainer if I remind English readers
that the Irish in the United States numbered in 1880 nearly
2,000,000, and that the number of persons of Irish parentage
is probably between 4,000,000 and 5,000,000. In short
there are, as well as one can judge, more Irish nationalists
in the United States than in Ireland. The Irish-Americans
are to-day the only large and prosperous Irish community in
the world. The children of the Irish born in the United
States or brought there in their infancy are just as Irish in
<!-- Page 135 --><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135" />their politics as those who have grown up at home. Patrick
Ford, for instance, the editor of the <i>Irish World</i>, who
is such a shape of dread to some Englishmen, came to
America in childhood, and has no personal knowledge nor
recollection of Irish wrongs. Of the part this large Irish
community plays in stimulating agitation&mdash;both agrarian and
political&mdash;at home I need not speak; Englishmen are very
familiar with it, and are very indignant over it. The Irish-Americans
not only send over a great deal of American
money to their friends at home, but they send over American
ideas, and foremost among them American hostility to large
landowners, and American belief in Home Rule. Now, to
me, one of the most curious things in the English state of
mind about the Irish problem is the apparent expectation
that this Irish-American interference is transient, and will
probably soon die out. It is quite true, as Englishmen are
constantly told, that &quot;the best Americans,&quot; that is, the
literary people and the commercial magnates, whom travelling
Englishmen see on the Atlantic coast, dislike the Irish
anti-English agitation. But it is also true that the disapproval
of the &quot;best Americans&quot; is not of the smallest
practical consequence, particularly as it is largely due to
complete indifference to, and ignorance of, the whole subject.
There are probably not a dozen of them who would venture
to express their disapproval publicly. The mass of the
population, particularly in the West, sympathize, though
half laughingly, with the efforts of the transplanted Irish to
&quot;twist the British lion's tail,&quot; and all the politicians either
sympathize with them, or pretend to do so. I am not now
expressing any opinion as to whether this state of things is
good or bad. What I wish to point out is that this Irish-American
influence on Irish affairs is very powerful, and
may, for all practical purposes, be considered permanent,
and must be taken into account as a constant element in
the Irish problem. I will indeed venture on the assertion
<!-- Page 136 --><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136" />that it is the appearance of the Irish-Americans on the
scene which has given the Irish question its present
seriousness. The attempts of the Irish at physical resistance
to English authority have been steadily diminishing in
gravity during the present century&mdash;witness the descent
from the rebellion of 1798 to Smith O'Brien's rebellion and
the Fenian rising of 1867. On the other hand the power
of the Irish to act as a disturbing agency in English politics
has greatly increased, and the reason is that the stream of
Irish discontent is fed by thousands of rills from the United
States. Every emigrant's letter, every Irish-American
newspaper, every returned emigrant with money in his
pocket and a good coat on his back, helps to swell it,
and there is not the slightest sign, that I can see, of its
drying up.</p>

<p>Where Mr. Dicey is most formidable to the Home
Rulers, as it seems to me, is in his chapter on &quot;Home Rule
as Federalism,&quot; which is the form in which the Irish ask
for it. He attacks this in two ways. One is by maintaining
that the necessary conditions for a federal union between
Great Britain and Ireland do not exist. This disposes at
one blow of all the experience derived from the working of
the foreign federations, on which the advocates of Home
Rule have relied a good deal. The other is what I may
call predictions that the federation even if set up would not
work. Either the state of facts on which all other federations
have been built does not exist in Ireland, or if it now
exists, will not, owing to the peculiarities of Irish character,
continue to exist. In other words, the federation will
either fail at the outset, or fail in the long run. No one
can admire more than I do the force and ingenuity and
wealth of illustration with which Mr. Dicey supports this
thesis. But unfortunately the arguments by which he
assails Irish federalism might be, or might have been, used
against all federations whatever. They might have been
<!-- Page 137 --><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137" />used, as I shall try to show, against the most successful of
them all, the Government of the United States. I was reminded,
while reading Mr. Dicey's account of the impossibility
of an Anglo-Irish federation, of Mr. Madison's
rehearsal in the <i>Federalist</i> (No. 38) of the objections made
to the Federal Constitution after the Convention had submitted
it to the States. These objections covered every
feature in it but one; and that, the mode of electing the
President, curiously enough, is the only one which can be
said to have utterly failed. A more impressive example
of the danger of <i>&agrave; priori</i> attacks on any political arrangement,
history does not contain. Mr. Madison says:
&quot;This one tells me that the proposed Constitution ought
to be rejected, because it is not a confederation of the
states, but a government over individuals. Another admits
that it ought to be a government over individuals to a
certain extent, but by no means to the extent proposed.
A third does not object to the government over individuals,
or to the extent proposed, but to the want of a bill of rights.
A fourth concurs in the absolute necessity of a bill of rights,
but contends that it ought to be declaratory not of the
personal rights of individuals, but of the rights reserved
to the states in their political capacity. A fifth is of opinion
that a bill of rights of any sort would be superfluous and
misplaced, and that the plan would be unexceptionable but
for the fatal power of regulating the times and places of
election. An objector in a large state exclaims loudly
against the unreasonable equality of representation in the
Senate. An objector in a small state is equally loud against
the dangerous inequality in the House of Representatives.
From one quarter we are alarmed with the amazing expense,
from the number of persons who are to administer the new
government. From another quarter, and sometimes from
the same quarter, on another occasion the cry is that the
Congress will be but the shadow of a representation, and
<!-- Page 138 --><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138" />that the government would be far less objectionable if the
number and the expense were doubled. A patriot in a
state that does not import or export discerns insuperable
objections against the power of direct taxation. The
patriotic adversary in a state of great exports and imports
is not less dissatisfied that the whole burden of taxes may
be thrown on consumption. This politician discovers in
the constitution a direct and irresistible tendency to monarchy.
That is equally sure it will end in aristocracy.
Another is puzzled to say which of these shapes it will
ultimately assume, but sees clearly it must be one or other
of them. Whilst a fourth is not wanting, who with no less
confidence affirms that the Constitution is so far from
having a bias towards either of these dangers, that the
weight on that side will not be sufficient to keep it upright
and firm against the opposite propensities. With another
class of adversaries to the Constitution, the language is,
that the legislative, executive, and judiciary departments
are intermixed in such a manner as to contradict all the
ideas of regular government and all the requisite precautions
in favour of liberty. Whilst this objection circulates
in vague and general expressions, there are not a few who
lend their sanction to it. Let each one come forward with
his particular explanation, and scarcely any two are exactly
agreed on the subject. In the eyes of one the junction
of the Senate with the President in the responsible function
of appointing to offices, instead of vesting this power in the
executive alone, is the vicious part of the organization. To
another the exclusion of the House of Representatives,
whose numbers alone could be a due security against corruption
and partiality in the exercise of such a power, is
equally obnoxious. With a third the admission of the
President into any share of a power which must ever be
a dangerous engine in the hands of the executive magistrate
is an unpardonable violation of the maxims of republican
<!-- Page 139 --><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139" />jealousy. No part of the arrangement, according to some,
is more inadmissible than the trial of impeachments by the
Senate, which is alternately a member both of the legislative
and executive departments, when this power so evidently
belonged to the judiciary department. We concur fully,
reply others, in the objection to this part of the plan, but
we can never agree that a reference of impeachments to the
judiciary authority would be an amendment of the error;
our principal dislike to the organization arises from the
extensive powers already lodged in that department. Even
among the zealous patrons of a council of state, the most
irreconcilable variance is discovered concerning the mode
in which it ought to be constituted.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Madison's challenge to the opponents of the American
Constitution to agree on some plan of their own, and his
humorous suggestion that if the American people had to
wait for some such agreement to be reached they would
go for a long time without a government, are curiously
applicable to the opponents of Irish Home Rule. They
are very fertile in reasons for thinking that neither the
Gladstone plan nor any other plan can succeed, but no
two of them, so far as I know, have yet hit upon any other
mode of pacifying Ireland, except the use of force for a
certain period to maintain order, and oddly enough, even
when they agree on this remedy, they are apt to disagree
about the length of time during which it should be tried.</p>

<p>Mr. Dicey, in conceding the success of the American
Constitution, seems to me unmindful, if I may use the
expression, of the judgments he would probably have passed
on it had it been submitted to him at the outset were he
in the frame of mind to which a prolonged study of the
Irish problem has now brought him. The Supreme Court,
for instance, which he now recognizes as an essential
feature of the Federal Constitution, and the absence of
which in the Gladstonian arrangement he treats as a fatal
<!-- Page 140 --><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140" />defect, would have undoubtedly appeared to him a preposterous
contrivance. It would have seemed to him impossible
that a legislature like Congress, with the traditions
of parliamentary omnipotence still strong in the minds of
the members, would ever submit to have its acts nullified
by a board composed of half a dozen elderly lawyers. Nor
would he have treated as any more reasonable the expectation
that the State tribunals, which had existed in each
colony from its foundation, and had earned the respect and
confidence of the people, would quietly submit to have their
jurisdiction curtailed, their decisions overruled, causes torn
from their calendar, and prisoners taken out of their custody
by new courts of semi-foreign origin, which the State neither
paid nor controlled. He would, too, very probably have
been most incredulous about the prospect of the growth of
loyalty on the part of New-Yorkers and Massachusetts men
to a new-fangled government, which was to make itself only
slightly felt in their daily lives, and was to sit a fortnight
away in an improvised village in the midst of a Virginian
forest.</p>

<p>He would, too, have ridiculed the notion that State
legislatures would refrain, in obedience to the Constitution,
from passing any law which local sentiment strongly favoured
or local convenience plainly demanded, such as a law impairing
the obligation of obnoxious contracts, or levying
duties on imports or exports. The possibility that the State
militia could ever be got to obey federal officers, or form an
efficient part of a federal army, he would have scouted. On
the feebleness of the front which federation would present
to a foreign enemy he would have dwelt with emphasis,
and would have pointed with confidence to the probability
that in the event of a war some of the states would make
terms with him or secretly favour his designs. National
allegiance and local allegiance would divide and perplex
the feelings of loyal citizens. Unless the national sentiment
<!-- Page 141 --><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141" />predominated&mdash;and it could not predominate without having
had time to grow&mdash;the federation would go to pieces at any
of those crises when the interests or wishes of any of the
states conflicted with the interests or wishes of the Union.
That the national sentiment could grow at all rapidly, considering
the maturity of the communities which composed
the Union and the differences of origin, creed, and manners
which separated them, no calm observer of human nature
would believe for one moment.</p>

<p>The American Constitution is flecked throughout with
those flaws which a lawyer delights to discover and point
out, and which the framers of a federal contract can only
excuse by maintaining that they are inevitable. It is true
that Mr. Dicey does not even now acknowledge the success
of the American Constitution to be complete. He points
out that if the &quot;example either of America or of Switzerland
is to teach us anything worth knowing, the history of
these countries must be read as a whole. It will then be
seen that the two most successful confederacies in the
world have been kept together only by the decisive triumph
through force of arms of the central power over real or
alleged State rights&quot; (p. 192).</p>

<p>It is odd that such objectors do not see that the decisive
triumph of the central power in the late civil war in
America was, in reality, a striking proof of the success of the
federation. The armies which General Grant commanded,
and the enormous resources in money and devotion from
which he was able to draw, were the product of the Federal
Union and of nothing else. One of the greatest arguments
its founders used in its favour was that if once established
it would supply overwhelming force for the suppression of
any attempt to break it up. They did not aim at setting
up a government which neither foreign malice nor domestic
treason, would ever assail, for they knew that this was
something beyond the reach of human endeavour. They
<!-- Page 142 --><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142" />tried to set up one which, if attacked either from within or
from without, would make a successful resistance, and we now
know that they accomplished their object. Somewhat the
same answer may be made to the objection, which is supposed
to have fatal applicability to the case of Ireland, that
among the &quot;special faults of federalism&quot; is that it does not
provide &quot;sufficient protection of the legal rights of unpopular
minorities,&quot; and that &quot;the moral of it all is that the
[American] Federal Government is not able to protect the
rights of individuals against strong local sentiment&quot; (p. 194
of Mr. Dicey's book). He says, moreover, if I understand
the argument rightly, that it was bound to protect free speech
in the States because &quot;there is not and never was a word in
the Articles of the Constitution forbidding American citizens
to criticize the institutions of the State.&quot; It would seem from
this as if Mr. Dicey were under the impression that in
America the citizen of a State has a right to do in his State
whatever he is not forbidden to do by the Federal Constitution,
and in doing it has a right to federal protection.
But the Federal Government can only do what the Constitution
expressly authorizes it to do, and the Constitution
does not authorize it to protect a citizen in criticizing the
institutions of his own State. This arrangement, too, is
just as good federalism as the committal of free speech to
federal guardianship would have been. The goodness or
badness of the federal system is in no way involved in the
matter.</p>

<p>The question to what extent a minority shall rely on the
federation for protection, and to what extent on its own
State, is a matter settled by the contract which has
created the federation. The settlement of this is, in fact,
the great object of a Constitution. Until it is settled
somehow, either by writing or by understanding, there is,
and can be, no federation. If I, as a citizen of the State
of New York, could call on the United States Government
<!-- Page 143 --><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143" />to protect me under all circumstances and against all
wrongs, it would show that I was not living under a
federation at all, but under a centralized republic. The
reason why I have to rely on the United States for protection
against some things and not against others is that it was so
stipulated when the State of New York entered the Union.
There is nothing in the nature of the federal system to
prevent the United States Government from protecting my
freedom of speech. Nor is there anything in the federal
system which forbids its protecting me against the establishment
of a State Church, which, as a matter of fact, it does
not do. Nor is there anything in the federal system compelling
the Government to protect me against the establishment
of an order of nobility, which, as a matter of fact, it does
do. The reason why it does not do one of these things
and does the other is simply and solely that it was so
stipulated, after much discussion, in the contract. Most
thinking men are to-day of opinion that the United States
ought to have exclusive jurisdiction of marriage, so that the
law of marriage might be uniform in all parts of the Union.
The reason why they do not possess such jurisdiction is not
that Congress is not fully competent to pass such a law or
the federal courts to execute it, but that no such jurisdiction
is conferred by the Constitution. In fact it seems to me
just as reasonable to cite the ease of divorce in various
States of the Union as a defect in the federal system, as to
cite the oppression of local minorities in matters not placed
under federal authority by the organic law.</p>

<p>If one may judge from a great deal of writing on American
matters which one sees in English journals and the demands
for federal interference in America in State affairs which
they constantly make, the greatest difficulty Irish Home
Rule has to contend with is the difficulty which men bred
in a united monarchy and under an omnipotent Parliament
experience in grasping what I may call the federal idea.<!-- Page 144 --><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144" />
The influence of association on their minds is so strong
that they can hardly conceive of a central power, worthy of
the name of a government, standing by and witnessing
disorders or failures of justice in any place within its
borders, without stepping in to set matters right, no matter
what the Constitution may say. They remind me often of
an old verger in Westminster Abbey during the American
civil war who told me that &quot;he always knew a government
without a head couldn't last.&quot; Permanence and
peace were in his mind inseparably linked with kingship.
That even Mr. Dicey has not been able to escape this
influence appears frequently in his discussions of federalism.
He, of course, thoroughly understands the federal system
as a jurist, but when he comes to discuss it as a politician he
has evidently some difficulty in seeing how a government
with a power to enforce <i>any</i> commands can be restrained
by contract from enforcing <i>all</i> commands which may seem
to be expedient or salutary. Consequently the cool way
in which the Federal Government here looks on at local
disorders seems to him a sign, not of the fidelity of the
President and Congress to the federal pact, but of some
inherent weakness in the federal system.</p>

<p>The true way to judge the federal system, however, either
in the United States or elsewhere, is by observing the
manner in which it has performed the duties assigned to
it by the Constitution. If the Government at Washington
performs these faithfully, its failure to prevent lawlessness in
New York or the oppression of minorities in Connecticut
is of no more consequence than its failure to put down
brigandage in Macedonia. Possibly it would have been
better to saddle it with greater responsibility for local peace;
but the fact is that the framers of the Constitution decided
not to do so. They did not mean to set up a government
which would see that every man living under it got his due.
They could not have got the States to accept such a
<!-- Page 145 --><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145" />government. They meant to set up a government which
should represent the nation worthily in all its relations with
foreigners, which should carry on war effectively, protect life
and property on the high seas, furnish a proper currency,
put down all resistance to its lawful authority, and secure
each State against domestic violence on the demand of its
Legislature.</p>

<p>There is no common form for federal contracts, and no
rules describing what such a contract must contain in order
that the Government may be federal and not unitarian.
There is no hard and fast line which must, under the federal
system, divide the jurisdiction of the central Government
from the jurisdiction of each State Government. The way
in which the power is divided between the two must necessarily
depend on the traditions, manners, aims, and needs
of the people of the various localities. The federal system
is not a system manufactured on a regulation model, which
can be sent over the world like iron huts or steam launches,
in detached pieces, to be put together when the scene of
operation is reached. Therefore I am unable to see the
force of the argument that, as the conditions under which
all existing federations were established differ in some
respects from those under which the proposed federal union
between England and Ireland would have to be established,
therefore the success of these confederations, such as it is,
gives them no value as precedents. A system which might
have worked very well for the New England States would
not have worked well for a combination which included
also the middle and southern States. And the framers
of the American Constitution were not so simple-minded as
to inquire, either before beginning their labours or before
ending them&mdash;as Mr. Dicey would apparently have the
English and Irish do&mdash;whether this or that style of constitution
was &quot;the correct thing&quot; in federalism. Assuming
that the people desired to form a nation as regarded the
<!-- Page 146 --><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146" />world outside, they addressed themselves to the task of
discovering how much power the various States were willing
to surrender for this purpose. That was ascertained, as far
as it could be ascertained, by assembling their delegates
in convention, and discussing the wishes and fears and
suggestions of the different localities in a friendly and conciliatory
spirit. They had no precedents to guide them.
There had not existed a federal government, either in ancient
or modern times, whose working afforded an example by
which the imagination or the understanding of the American
people was likely to be affected in the smallest degree.
They, therefore, had to strike out an entirely new path for
themselves, and they ended by producing an absolutely new
kind of federation, which was half Unitarian, that is, in some
respects a union of states, and in others a centralized
government; and it was provided for a Territory one end of
which was more than a month's distance from the other.</p>

<p>It is not in its details, therefore, but in the manner of its
construction, that the American Constitution furnishes anything
in the way of guidance or suggestion to those who
are now engaged in trying to find a <i>modus vivendi</i> between
England and Ireland. The same thing may be said of the
Swiss Constitution and of the Austro-Hungarian Constitution.
Both of them contain many anomalies&mdash;that is,
things that are not set down in the books as among the
essentials of federalism. But both are adapted to the
special wants of the people who live under them, and were
framed in reference to those wants.</p>

<p>The Austro-Hungarian Delegations are another exception
to the rule. These Delegations undoubtedly control
the ministry of the Empire, or at all events do in practice
displace it by their votes. It is made formally responsible
to them by the Constitution. All that Mr. Dicey can say
to this is that &quot;the real responsibility of the Ministry to the
Delegations admits of a good deal of doubt,&quot; and that,
<!-- Page 147 --><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147" />at all events, it is not like the responsibility of Mr.
Gladstone or Lord Salisbury to the British Parliament.
This may be true, but the more mysterious or peculiar it
is the better it illustrates the danger of speaking of any
particular piece of machinery or of any particular division
of power as an essential feature of a federal constitution.</p>

<p>We are told by the critics of the Gladstonian scheme
that federalism is not &quot;a plan for disuniting the parts of a
united state.&quot; But whether it is or not once more depends
on circumstances. Federalism, like the British or French
Constitution, is an arrangement intended to satisfy the people
who set it up by gratifying some desire or removing some
cause of discontent. If that discontent be due to unity,
federalism disunites; if it be due to disunion, federalism
unites. In the case of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, for
instance, it clearly is a &quot;plan for disuniting the parts of
a united state.&quot; Austria and Hungary were united in
the sense in which the opponents of Home Rule use the
word for many years before 1867, but the union did not
work, that is, did not produce moral as well as legal
unity. A constitution was therefore invented which disunites
the two countries for the purposes of domestic
legislation, but leaves them united for the purposes of
foreign relations. This may be a queer arrangement.
Although it has worked well enough thus far, it may not
continue to work well, but it does work well now. It
has succeeded in converting Hungary from a discontented
and rebellious province and a source of great weakness to
Austria into a loyal and satisfied portion of the Empire. In
other words, it has accomplished its purpose. It was not
intended to furnish a symmetrical piece of federalism. It
was intended to conciliate the Hungarian people. When
therefore the professional federal architects make their tour
of inspection and point out to the Home Ruler what
flagrant departures from the correct federal model the<!-- Page 148 --><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148" />
Austro-Hungarian Constitution contains, how improbable
it is that so enormous a structure can endure, and how,
after all, the Hungarians have not got rid of the Emperor,
who commands the army and represents the brute force
of the old <i>r&eacute;gime</i>, I do not think he need feel greatly
concerned. This may be all true, and yet the Austro-Hungarian
federalism is a valuable thing. It has proved
that the federal remedy is good for more than one disease,
that it can cure both too much unity and too little. The
truth is that there are only two essentials of a federal
government. One is an agreement between the various
communities who are to live under it as to the manner in
which the power is to be divided between the general and
local governments; the other is an honest desire on the
part of all concerned to make it succeed. As a general
rule, whatever the parties agree on and desire to make work
is likely to work, just as a Unitarian government is sure
to succeed if the people who live under it determine that
it shall succeed. If a federal plan be settled in the only
right way, by amicable and mutually respectful discussion
between representative men, all the more serious obstacles
are certain to be revealed and removed. Those which are
not brought to light by such discussions are pretty sure
to be comparatively trifling, and to disappear before the
general success of arrangement. But by a &quot;mutually
respectful discussion&quot; I mean discussion in which good
faith and intelligence of all concerned are acknowledged on
both sides.</p>

<p>In what I have said by way of criticism of a book which
may be taken as a particularly full exposition of the legal
criticism that may be levelled at Mr. Gladstone's scheme,
I have not touched on the arguments against Home Rule
which Mr. Dicey draws from the amount of disturbance it
would cause in English political habits and arrangements.
I freely admit the weight of these arguments. The task of
<!-- Page 149 --><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149" />any English statesman who gives Home Rule to Ireland
in the only way in which it can be given&mdash;with the assent
of the British people&mdash;will be a very arduous one. But
this portion of Mr. Dicey's book, producing, as it does, the
distinctively English objections to Home rule, is to me
much the most instructive, because it shows the difficulty
there would be in creating the state of mind in England
about any federal relation to Ireland which would be
necessary to make it succeed. I do not think it an exaggeration
to say that two-thirds of the English objections to
Home Rule as federalism are unconscious expressions of distrust
of Irish sincerity or intelligence thrown into the form of
prophecy, and prophets, as we all know, cannot be refuted.
For instance, &quot;the changes necessitated by federalism would
all tend to weaken the power of Great Britain&quot; (Dicey, p.
173). The question of the command of the army could not
be arranged; the Irish army could not be depended on by
the Crown (p. 174); the central Government would be feeble
against foreign aggression, and the Irish Parliament would
give aid to a foreign enemy (pp. 176-7). Federalism would
aggravate or increase instead of diminishing the actual Irish
disloyalty to the Crown (pp. 179-80); the Irish expectations
of material prosperity from Home Rule are baseless or
grossly exaggerated (p. 182); the probability is, it would
produce increased poverty and hardship; there would be
frequent quarrels between the two countries over questions
of nullification, secession, and federal taxation (p. 184);
neither side would acquiesce in the decision either of the
Privy Council or of any other tribunal on these questions;
Home Rulers would be the first to resist these decisions
(p. 185). Irish federation &quot;would soon generate a demand
that the whole British Empire should be turned into a Confederacy&quot;
(p. 188). Finally, as &quot;the one prediction which
may be made with absolute confidence,&quot; &quot;federalism would
not generate the goodwill between England and Ireland
<!-- Page 150 --><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150" />which, could it be produced, would be an adequate compensation
even for the evils and inconveniences of a federal
system&quot; (p. 191).</p>

<p>Now I do not myself believe these things, but what else
can any advocate of Home Rule say in answer to them?
They are in their very nature the utterances of a prophet&mdash;an
able, acute, and fair-minded prophet, I grant, but still a
prophet&mdash;and before a prophet the wisest man has to be
silent, or content himself by answering in prophecy also.
What makes the sceptical frame of mind in which Mr.
Dicey approaches the Home Rule question so important is
not simply that it probably represents that of a very large
body of educated Englishmen, but that it is one in which
a federal system cannot be produced. Faith, hope, and
charity are political as well as social virtues. The minute
you leave the region of pure despotism and try any form of
government in which the citizen has in the smallest degree
to co-operate in the execution of the laws, you have need
of these virtues at every step. As soon as you give up the
attempt to rule men by drumhead justice, you have to begin
to trust in some degree to their intelligence, to their love of
order, to their self-respect, and to their desire for material
prosperity, and the nearer you get to what is called free
government the larger this trust has to be. It has to be
very large indeed in order to carry on such a government
as that of Great Britain or of the United States; it has to
be larger still in order to set up and administer a federal
government. In such a government the worst that can
happen is very patent. The opportunities which the best-drawn
federal constitution offers for outbreaks of what
Americans call &quot;pure cussedness&quot;&mdash;that is, for the indulgence
of anarchical tendencies and impulses&mdash;is greater
than in any other. Therefore, to set it up, or even to
discuss it with any profit, your faith in the particular variety
of human nature, which is to live under it, has to be great.<!-- Page 151 --><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151" />
No communities can live under it together and make it work
which do not respect each other. I say respect, I do not
say love, each other. The machine can be made to go a
good while without love, and if it goes well it will bring love
before long; but mutual respect is necessary from the first
day. This is why Mr. Dicey's book is discouraging. The
arguments which he addressed to Englishmen would not, I
think, be formidable but for the mood in which he finds
Englishmen, and that this mood makes against Home Rule
there can be little doubt.</p>

<p>I am often asked by Americans why the English do not
call an Anglo-Irish convention in the American fashion, and
discuss the Irish question with the Irish, find out exactly
what they will take to be quiet, and settle with them in a
rational way. I generally answer that, in the first place, a
convention is a constitution-making agency with which the
English public is totally unfamiliar, and that, in the second
place, Englishmen's temper is too imperial, or rather imperious,
to make the idea of discussion on equal terms with the
Irish at all acceptable. They are, in fact, so far from any
such arrangement that&mdash;preposterous and even funny as it
seems to the American mind&mdash;to say that an English statesman
is carrying on any sort of communication with the
representatives of the Irish people is to bring against him,
in English eyes, a very damaging accusation. When a man
like Mr. Matthew Arnold writes to the <i>Times</i> to contend
that Englishmen should find out what the Irish want solely
for the purpose of not letting them have it, and a journal
like the <i>Spectator</i> maintains that the sole excuse for extending
the suffrage in Ireland, as it has lately been extended in
England, was that the Irish as a minority would not be
able to make any effective use of it; and when another
political philosopher writes a long and very solemn letter
in which, while conceding that in governing Ireland a
sympathetic regard for Irish feelings and interests should
<!-- Page 152 --><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152" />be displayed, he mentions, as one of the leading facts
of the situation, that in &quot;the Irish character there is a
grievous lack of independence, of self-respect, of courage,
and above all of truthfulness&quot;&mdash;when men of this kind talk
in this way, it is easy to see that the mental and moral conditions
necessary to the successful formation of a federal
union are still far off. No federal government, and no
government requiring loyalty and fidelity for its successful
working, was ever set up by, or even discussed between, two
parties, one of which thought the other so unreasonable that
it should be carefully denied everything it asked for and as
unfit for any sort of political co-operation as mendacity,
cowardice, and slavishness could make it.</p>

<p>Finally let me say that there is nothing in Mr. Dicey's
book which has surprised me more, considering with what
singular intellectual integrity he attacks every point, than
his failure to make any mention or to take any account of
the large part which time and experience must necessarily
play in bringing to perfection any political arrangement
which is made to order, if I may use the expression, no
matter how carefully it may be drafted. Hume says on this
point with great wisdom, &quot;To balance the large state or
society, whether monarchical or republican, on general
laws, is a work of so great difficulty, that no human genius,
however comprehensive, is able by the mere dint of reason
or reflection to effect it. The judgments of many must
unite in the work, experience must guide their labour, time
must bring it to perfection, and the feeling of inconveniences
must correct the mistakes which they inevitably fall into in
their first trial and experiments.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25" /><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>This has proved true of the American and Swiss federations;
it will probably prove true of the Austro-Hungarian
federation and of any that may be set up by Great Britian [Transcriber: sic.]
and her colonies. It will prove still more true of any
<!-- Page 153 --><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153" />attempt that may be made at federation between Great
Britain and Ireland. No corrections which could be made
in the Gladstonian or any other constitution would make
it work exactly on the lines laid down by its framers. Even
if it were revised in accordance with Mr. Dicey's criticism,
it would probably be found, as in the case of the American
Constitution, that few of the dangers which were most feared
for it had beset it, and that some of the inconveniences
which were most distinctly foreseen as likely to arise from it
were among the things which had materially contributed to
its success. History is full of the gentle ridicule which the
course of events throws on statesmen and philosophers.<!-- Page 154 --><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154" /></p>

<h2><a name="THE_UNIONISTquot_CASE_FOR_HOME" id="THE_UNIONISTquot_CASE_FOR_HOME" />THE &quot;UNIONIST&quot; CASE FOR HOME
RULE.</h2>


<p class="author">BY R. BARRY O'BRIEN.</p>


<p>I am often asked, What are the best books to read on the
Irish question? and I never fail to mention Mr. Lecky's
<i>Leaders of Public Opinion in Ireland</i> and the <i>History
of England in the Eighteenth Century</i>; Mr. Goldwin
Smith's <i>Irish History and Irish Character, Three English
Statesmen, The Irish Question</i>, and Professor Dicey's admirable
work, <i>England's Case against Home Rule</i>.</p>

<p>Indeed, the case for Home Rule, as stated in these
books, is unanswerable; and it redounds to the credit of
Mr. Lecky, Mr. Goldwin Smith, and Mr. Dicey that their
narrative of facts should in no wise be prejudiced by their
political opinions.</p>

<p>That their facts are upon one side and their opinions
on the other is a minor matter. Their facts, I venture
to assert, have made more Home Rulers than their opinions
can unmake.</p>

<p>To put this assertion to the test I propose to quote
some extracts from the works above mentioned. These
extracts shall be full and fair. Nothing shall be left out
that can in the slightest degree qualify any statement of
fact in the context. Arguments will be omitted, for I wish
to place facts mainly before my readers. From these facts
<!-- Page 155 --><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155" />they can draw their own conclusions. Neither shall I take
up space with comments of my own. I shall call my
witnesses and let them speak for themselves.</p>

<p>I.&mdash;MR. LECKY.</p>

<p>In the introduction to the new edition of the <i>Leaders
of Public Opinion in Ireland</i>, published in 1871&mdash;seventy-one
years after Mr. Pitt's Union, which was to make
England and Ireland one nation&mdash;we find the following
&quot;contrast&quot; between &quot;national life&quot; in the two countries:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;There is, perhaps, no Government in the world which
succeeds more admirably in the functions of eliciting,
sustaining, and directing public opinion than that of
England. It does not, it is true, escape its full share of
hostile criticism, and, indeed, rather signally illustrates the
saying of Bacon, that 'the best Governments are always
subject to be like the finest crystals, in which every icicle
and grain is seen which in a fouler stone is never perceived;'
but whatever charges may be brought against the
balance of its powers, or against its legislative efficiency,
few men will question its eminent success as an organ of
public opinion. In England an even disproportionate
amount of the national talent takes the direction of politics.
The pulse of an energetic national life is felt in every
quarter of the land. The debates of Parliament are
followed with a warm, constant, and intelligent interest by
all sections of the community. It draws all classes within
the circle of political interests, and is the centre of a strong
and steady patriotism, equally removed from the apathy of
many Continental nations in time of calm, and from their
feverish and spasmodic energy in time of excitement. Its
decisions, if not instantly accepted, never fail to have a
profound and calming influence on the public mind. It
is the safety-valve of the nation. The discontents, the
<!-- Page 156 --><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156" />suspicions, the peccant humours that agitate the people,
find there their vent, their resolution, and their end.</p>

<p>&quot;It is impossible, I think, not to be struck by the contrast
which, in this respect, Ireland presents to England.
If the one country furnishes us with an admirable example
of the action of a healthy public opinion, the other supplies
us with the most unequivocal signs of its disease. The
Imperial Parliament exercises for Ireland legislative functions,
but it is almost powerless upon opinion&mdash;it allays no discontent,
and attracts no affection. Political talent, which
for many years was at least as abundant among Irishmen
as in any equally numerous section of the people, has been
steadily declining, and marked decadence in this respect
among the representatives of the nation reflects but too
truly the absence of public spirit in their constituents.</p>

<p>&quot;The upper classes have lost their sympathy with and
their moral ascendency over their tenants, and are thrown
for the most part into a policy of mere obstruction. The
genuine national enthusiasm never flows in the channel of
imperial politics. With great multitudes sectarian considerations
have entirely superseded national ones, and their
representatives are accustomed systematically to subordinate
all party and all political questions to ecclesiastical interests;
and while calling themselves Liberals, they make it the
main object of their home politics to separate the different
classes of their fellow-countrymen during the period of their
education, and the main object of their foreign policy to
support the temporal power of the Pope. With another
and a still larger class the prevailing feeling seems to be
an indifference to all Parliamentary proceedings; an utter
scepticism about constitutional means of realizing their
ends; a blind, persistent hatred of England. Every cause
is taken up with an enthusiasm exactly proportioned to
the degree in which it is supposed to be injurious to English
interests. An amount of energy and enthusiasm which if
<!-- Page 157 --><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157" />rightly directed would suffice for the political regeneration
of Ireland is wasted in the most insane projects of disloyalty;
while the diversion of so much public feeling
from Parliamentary politics leaves the Parliamentary arena
more and more open to corruption, to place-hunting, and
to imposture.</p>

<p>&quot;This picture is in itself a very melancholy one, but there
are other circumstances which greatly heighten the effect.
In a very ignorant or a very wretched population it is
natural that there should be much vague, unreasoning discontent;
but the Irish people are at present neither
wretched nor ignorant. Their economical condition before
the famine was, indeed, such that it might well have made
reasonable men despair. With the land divided into almost
microscopic farms, with a population multiplying rapidly
to the extreme limits of subsistence, accustomed to the
very lowest standard of comfort, and marrying earlier than
in any other northern country in Europe, it was idle to look
for habits of independence or self-reliance, or for the culture
which follows in the train of leisure and comfort. But all
this has been changed. A fearful famine and the long-continued
strain of emigration have reduced the nation
from eight millions to less than five, and have effected, at
the price of almost intolerable suffering, a complete
economical revolution. The population is now in no
degree in excess of the means of subsistence. The rise of
wages and prices has diffused comfort through all classes.
... Probably no country in Europe has advanced so
rapidly as Ireland within the last ten years, and the tone of
cheerfulness, the improvement of the houses, the dress, and
the general condition of the people must have struck every
observer.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26" /><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> ... If industrial improvement, if the rapid
<!-- Page 158 --><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158" />increase of material comforts among the poor, could allay
political discontent, Ireland should never have been so
loyal as at present.</p>

<p>&quot;Nor can it be said that ignorance is at the root of the
discontent. The Irish people have always, even in the darkest
period of the penal laws, been greedy for knowledge, and
few races show more quickness in acquiring it. The
admirable system of national education established in the
present century is beginning to bear abundant fruit, and,
among the younger generation at least, the level of knowledge
is quite as high as in England. Indeed, one of the
most alarming features of Irish disloyalty is its close and
evident connection with education. It is sustained by a
cheap literature, written often with no mean literary skill,
which penetrates into every village, gives the people their first
political impressions, forms and directs their enthusiasm, and
seems likely in the long leisure of the pastoral life to exercise
an increasing power. Close observers of the Irish character
will hardly have failed to notice the great change which since
the famine has passed over the amusements of the people.
The old love of boisterous out-of-door sports has almost
disappeared, and those who would have once sought their
pleasures in the market or the fair now gather in groups in
the public-house, where one of their number reads out a
Fenian newspaper. Whatever else this change may portend,
it is certainly of no good omen for the future loyalty of the
people.</p>

<p>&quot;It was long customary in England to underrate this
disaffection by ascribing it to very transitory causes. The
quarter of a century that followed the Union was marked
by almost perpetual disturbance; but this it was said was
merely the natural ground swell of agitation which followed
a great reform. It was then the popular theory that it was
the work of O'Connell, who was described during many years
as the one obstacle to the peace of Ireland, and whose death
<!-- Page 159 --><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159" />was made the subject of no little congratulation, as though
Irish discontent had perished with its organ. It was as if,
the &AElig;olian harp being shattered, men wrote an epitaph
upon the wind. Experience has abundantly proved the
folly of such theories. Measured by mere chronology, a
little more than seventy years have passed since the Union,
but famine and emigration have compressed into these years
the work of centuries. The character, feelings, and conditions
of the people have been profoundly altered. A long
course of remedial legislation has been carried, and during
many years the national party has been without a leader
and without a stimulus. Yet, so far from subsiding, disloyalty
in Ireland is probably as extensive, and is certainly
as malignant, as at the death of O'Connell, only in many
respects the public opinion of the country has palpably
deteriorated. O'Connell taught an attachment to the connection,
a loyalty to the crown, a respect for the rights of
property, a consistency of Liberalism, which we look for in
vain among his successors; and that faith in moral force
and constitutional agitation which he made it one of his
greatest objects to instil into the people has almost vanished
with the failure of his agitation.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27" /><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Few Irish Nationalists have drawn a weightier indictment
against the Union than this. After a trial of seventy years,
Mr. Lecky sums up the case against the Union in these
pregnant sentences:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;The Imperial Parliament allays no discontent, and
attracts no affection;&quot; &quot;The genuine national enthusiasm
never flows in the channel of imperial politics;&quot;
the people have &quot;an utter scepticism about constitutional
means of realizing their ends,&quot; and are imbued with &quot;a
blind, persistent hatred of England.&quot; Worse still, neither
the material progress of the country, nor the education of
<!-- Page 160 --><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160" />the people, has reconciled them to the Imperial Parliament.
Indeed, their disloyalty has increased with their prosperity
and enlightenment. This is the story which Mr. Lecky has
to tell. But why are the Irish disloyal? Mr. Lecky shall
answer the question.</p>

<p>&quot;The causes of this deep-seated disaffection I have
endeavoured in some degree to investigate in the following
essays. To the merely dramatic historian the history of
Ireland will probably appear less attractive than that of most
other countries, for it is somewhat deficient in great characters
and in splendid episodes; but to a philosophic student
of history it presents an interest of the very highest order.
In no other history can we trace more clearly the chain of
causes and effects, the influence of past legislation, not only
upon the material condition, but also upon the character of
a nation. In no other history especially can we investigate
more fully the evil consequences which must ensue from
disregarding that sentiment of nationality which, whether it
be wise or foolish, whether it be desirable or the reverse,
is at least one of the strongest and most enduring of
human passions. This, as I conceive, lies at the root of
Irish discontent. It is a question of nationality as truly
as in Hungary or in Poland. Special grievances or
anomalies may aggravate, but do not cause it, and they
become formidable only in as far as they are connected
with it. What discontent was felt against the Protestant
Established Church was felt chiefly because it was regarded
as an English garrison sustaining an anti-national system;
and the agrarian difficulty never assumed its full intensity
till by the repeal agitation the landlords had been politically
alienated from the people.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28" /><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>Let those who imagine that the Irish question can be
<!-- Page 161 --><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161" />completely settled by the redress of material grievances
take those words to heart.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But, it is said, Scotch national sentiment is as strong as
Irish, why should not a legislative union be as acceptable
to Ireland as to Scotland? Mr. Lecky shall answer this
question too.</p>

<p>&quot;It is hardly possible to advert to the Scotch Union,
without pausing for a moment to examine why its influence
on the loyalty of the people should have ultimately been so
much happier than that of the legislative union which,
nearly a century later, was enacted between England and
Ireland. A very slight attention to the circumstances of
the case will explain the mystery, and will at the same time
show the extreme shallowness of those theorists who can
only account for it by reference to original peculiarities of
national character. The sacrifice of a nationality is a
measure which naturally produces such intense and such
enduring discontent that it never should be exacted unless
it can be accompanied by some political or material
advantages to the lesser country that are so great and
at the same time so evident as to prove a corrective. Such
a corrective in the case of Scotland, was furnished by the
commercial clauses. The Scotch Parliament was very
arbitrary and corrupt, and by no means a faithful representation
of the people. The majority of the nation were
certainly opposed to the Union, and, directly or indirectly,
it is probable that much corruption was employed to effect
it; but still the fact remains that by it one of the most
ardent wishes of all Scottish patriots was attained, that there
had been for many years a powerful and intelligent minority
who were prepared to purchase commercial freedom even
at the expense of the fusion of legislatures, and that in
consequence of the establishment of free trade the next
generation of Scotchmen witnessed an increase of material
<!-- Page 162 --><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162" />well-being that was utterly unprecedented in the history of
their country. Nothing equivalent took place in Ireland.
The gradual abolition of duties between England and
Ireland was, no doubt, an advantage to the lesser country,
but the whole trade to America and the other English
colonies had been thrown open to Irishmen between 1775
and 1779. Irish commerce had taken this direction; the
years between 1779 and the rebellion of 1798 were
probably the most prosperous in Irish history, and the
generation that followed the Union was one of the most
miserable. The sacrifice of nationality was extorted by
the most enormous corruption in the history of representative
institutions. It was demanded by no considerable
section of the Irish people. It was accompanied by no signal
political or material benefit that could mitigate or counteract
its unpopularity, and it was effected without a dissolution,
in opposition to the votes of the immense majority
of the representatives of the counties and considerable
towns, and to innumerable addresses from every part of the
country. Can any impartial man be surprised that such
a measure, carried in such a manner, should have proved
unsuccessful?&quot;<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29" /><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the <i>Leaders of Public Opinion in Ireland</i> Mr. Lecky
traces the current of events which have led to the present
situation. He shows how the Treaty of Limerick was shamelessly
violated, and how the native population was oppressed
and degraded.</p>

<p>&quot;The position of Ireland was at this time [1727] one
of the most deplorable that can be conceived.... The
Roman Catholics had been completely prostrated by the
battle of the Boyne and by the surrender of Limerick.
They had stipulated indeed for religious liberty, but the
<!-- Page 163 --><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163" />Treaty of Limerick was soon shamelessly violated, and it
found no avengers. Sarsfield and his brave companions
had abandoned a country where defeat left no opening for
their talents, and had joined the Irish Brigade which had
been formed in the service of France.... But while the
Irish Roman Catholics abroad found free scope for their
ambition in the service of France, those who remained at
home had sunk into a condition of utter degradation. All
Catholic energy and talent had emigrated to foreign lands,
and penal laws of atrocious severity crushed the Catholics
who remained.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30" /><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Lecky's account of these &quot;penal laws&quot; is upon
the whole, I think, the best that has been written.</p>

<p>&quot;The last great Protestant ruler of England was
William III., who is identified in Ireland with the humiliation
of the Boyne, with the destruction of Irish trade, and
with the broken Treaty of Limerick. The ceaseless exertions
of the extreme Protestant party have made him more odious
in the eyes of the people than he deserves to be; for he was
personally far more tolerant than the great majority of his
contemporaries, and the penal code was chiefly enacted
under his successors. It required, indeed, four or five
reigns to elaborate a system so ingeniously contrived to
demoralize, to degrade, and to impoverish the people of
Ireland. By this code the Roman Catholics were absolutely
excluded from the Parliament, from the magistracy, from
the corporations, from the bench, and from the bar. They
could not vote at Parliamentary elections or at vestries;
they could not act as constables, or sheriffs, or jurymen, or
serve in the army or navy, or become solicitors, or even
hold the positions of gamekeeper or watchman. Schools
were established to bring up their children as Protestants;
and if they refused to avail themselves of these, they were
deliberately assigned to hopeless ignorance, being excluded
<!-- Page 164 --><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164" />from the university, and debarred, under crushing penalties,
from acting as schoolmasters, as ushers, or as private
tutors, or from sending their children abroad to obtain the
instruction they were refused at home. They could not
marry Protestants, and if such a marriage were celebrated
it was annulled by law, and the priest who officiated might
be hung. They could not buy land, or inherit or receive
it as a gift from Protestants, or hold life-annuities, or leases
for more than thirty-one years, or any lease on such terms
that the profits of the land exceeded one-third of the rent.
If any Catholic leaseholder by his industry so increased
his profits that they exceeded this proportion, and did not
immediately make a corresponding increase in his payments,
any Protestant who gave the information could enter into
possession of his farm. If any Catholic had secretly purchased
either his old forfeited estate, or any other land, any
Protestant who informed against him might become the
proprietor. The few Catholic landowners who remained
were deprived of the right which all other classes possessed
of bequeathing their lands as they pleased. If their sons
continued Catholics, it was divided equally between them.
If, however, the eldest son consented to apostatize, the
estate was settled upon him, the father from that hour
became only a life-tenant, and lost all power of selling,
mortgaging, or otherwise disposing of it. If the wife of
a Catholic abandoned the religion of her husband, she was
immediately free from his control, and the Chancellor
was empowered to assign to her a certain proportion of her
husband's property. If any child, however young, professed
itself a Protestant, it was at once taken from the father's
care, and the Chancellor could oblige the father to declare
upon oath the value of his property, both real and personal,
and could assign for the present maintenance and future
portion of the converted child such proportion of that
property as the court might decree. No Catholic could be
<!-- Page 165 --><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165" />guardian either to his own children or to those of another
person; and therefore a Catholic who died while his
children were minors had the bitterness of reflecting upon
his death-bed that they must pass into the care of Protestants.
An annuity of from twenty to forty pounds was
provided as a bribe for every priest who would become
a Protestant. To convert a Protestant to Catholicism was
a capital offence. In every walk of life the Catholic was
pursued by persecution or restriction. Except in the linen
trade, he could not have more than two apprentices. He
could not possess a horse of the value of more than five
pounds, and any Protestant, on giving him five pounds, could
take his horse. He was compelled to pay double to the
militia. He was forbidden, except under particular conditions,
to live in Galway or Limerick. In case of war with
a Catholic power, the Catholics were obliged to reimburse
the damage done by the enemy's privateers. The Legislature,
it is true, did not venture absolutely to suppress their
worship, but it existed only by a doubtful connivance&mdash;stigmatized
as if it were a species of licensed prostitution,
and subject to conditions which, if they had been enforced,
would have rendered its continuance impossible. An old
law which prohibited it, and another which enjoined
attendance at the Anglican worship, remained unrepealed,
and might at any time be revived; and the former was, in
fact, enforced during the Scotch rebellion of 1715. The
parish priests, who alone were allowed to officiate, were
compelled to be registered, and were forbidden to keep
curates or to officiate anywhere except in their own parishes.
The chapels might not have bells or steeples. No crosses
might be publicly erected. Pilgrimages to the holy wells
were forbidden. Not only all monks and friars, but also
all Catholic archbishops, bishops, deacons, and other dignitaries,
were ordered by a certain day to leave the country;
and if after that date they were found in Ireland they were
<!-- Page 166 --><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166" />liable to be first imprisoned and then banished; and if after
that banishment they returned to discharge their duty in
their dioceses, they were liable to the punishment of death.
To facilitate the discovery of offences against the code, two
justices of the peace might at any time compel any Catholic
of eighteen years of age to declare when and where he last
heard Mass, what persons were present, and who officiated;
and if he refused to give evidence they might imprison him
for twelve months, or until he paid a fine of twenty pounds.
Any one who harboured ecclesiastics from beyond the seas
was subject to fines which for the third offence amounted
to confiscation of all his goods. A graduated scale of
rewards was offered for the discovery of Catholic bishops,
priests, and schoolmasters; and a resolution of the House
of Commons pronounced 'the prosecuting and informing
against Papists' 'an honourable service to the Government.'</p>

<p>&quot;Such were the principal articles of this famous code&mdash;a
code which Burke truly described as 'well digested and
well disposed in all its parts; a machine of wise and elaborate
contrivance, and as well fitted for the oppression, impoverishment,
and degradation of a people, and the debasement
in them of human nature itself, as ever proceeded
from the perverted ingenuity of man.'&quot;<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31" /><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>The effects of these laws Mr. Lecky has described thus:</p>

<p>&quot;The economical and moral effects of the penal laws
were, however, profoundly disastrous. The productive
energies of the nation were fatally diminished. Almost all
Catholics of energy and talent who refused to abandon their
faith emigrated to foreign lands. The relation of classes
was permanently vitiated; for almost all the proprietary of
the country belonged to one religion, while the great majority
of their tenants were of another. The Catholics, excluded
from almost every possibility of eminence, deprived of their
natural leaders, and consigned by the Legislature to utter
<!-- Page 167 --><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167" />ignorance, soon sank into the condition of broken and
dispirited helots. A total absence of industrial virtues, a
cowering and abject deference to authority, a recklessness
about the future, a love of secret illegal combinations,
became general among them. Above all, they learned
to regard law as merely the expression of force, and its
moral weight was utterly destroyed. For the greater part
of a century, the main object of the Legislature was to
extirpate a religion by the encouragement of the worst, and
the punishment of some of the best qualities of our
nature. Its rewards were reserved for the informer, for the
hypocrite, for the undutiful son, or for the faithless wife.
Its penalties were directed against religious constancy and
the honest discharge of ecclesiastical duty.</p>

<p>&quot;It would, indeed, be scarcely possible to conceive a more
infamous system of legal tyranny than that which in the
middle of the eighteenth century crushed every class and
almost every interest in Ireland.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32" /><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>But laws were not only passed against the native race
and the national religion. Measures were taken to destroy
the industries of the country, and to involve natives and
colonists, Protestants and Catholics, in common ruin.
Mr. Lecky shall tell the story.</p>

<p>&quot;The commercial and industrial condition of the
country was, if possible, more deplorable than its political
condition, and was the result of a series of English measures
which for deliberate and selfish tyranny could hardly be
surpassed. Until the reign of Charles II. the Irish shared
the commercial privileges of the English; but as the island
had not been really conquered till the reign of Elizabeth,
and as its people were till then scarcely removed from
barbarism, the progress was necessarily slow. In the early
Stuart reigns, however, comparative repose and good
government were followed by a sudden rush of prosperity.
<!-- Page 168 --><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168" />The land was chiefly pasture, for which it was admirably
adapted; the export of live cattle to England was carried on
upon a large scale, and it became a chief source of Irish
wealth. The English landowners, however, took the alarm.
They complained that Irish rivalry in the cattle market was
reducing English rents; and accordingly, by an Act which
was first passed in 1663, and was made perpetual in 1666,
the importation of cattle into England was forbidden.</p>

<p>&quot;The effect of a measure of this kind, levelled at the
principal article of the commerce of the nation, was necessarily
most disastrous. The profound modification which it
introduced into the course of Irish industry was sufficiently
shown by the estimate of Sir W. Petty, who declares that
before the statute three-fourths of the trade of Ireland was
with England, but not one-fourth of it since that time. In
the very year when this Bill was passed another measure
was taken not less fatal to the interest of the country. In
the first Navigation Act, Ireland was placed on the same
terms as England; but in the Act as amended in 1663 she
was omitted, and was thus deprived of the whole Colonial
trade. With the exception of a very few specified articles
no European merchandise could be imported into the
British Colonies except directly from England, in ships built
in England, and manned chiefly by English sailors. No
articles, with a few exceptions, could be brought from the
Colonies to Europe without being first unladen in England.
In 1670 this exclusion of Ireland was confirmed, and in
1696 it was rendered more stringent, for it was enacted that
no goods of any sort could be imported directly from the
Colonies to Ireland. It will be remembered that at this
time the chief British Colonies were those of America, and
that Ireland, by her geographical position, was naturally of
all countries most fitted for the American trade.</p>

<p>&quot;As far, then, as the Colonial trade was concerned,
Ireland at this time gained nothing whatever by her con<!-- Page 169 --><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169" />nection
with England. To other countries, however, her
ports were still open, and in time of peace a foreign
commerce was unrestricted. When forbidden to export
their cattle to England, the Irish turned their land chiefly
into sheep-walks, and proceeded energetically to manufacture
the wool. Some faint traces of this manufacture may be
detected from an early period, and Lord Strafford, when
governing Ireland, had mentioned it with a characteristic
comment. Speaking of the Irish he says, 'There was little
or no manufactures amongst them, but some small beginnings
towards a cloth trade, which I had and so should still discourage
all I could, unless otherwise directed by His
Majesty and their Lordships. It might be feared that they
would beat us out of the trade itself by underselling us,
which they were able to do.' With the exception, however, of
an abortive effort by this governor, the Irish wool manufacture
was in no degree impeded, and was indeed mentioned
with special favour in many Acts of Parliament; and it was
in a great degree on the faith of this long-continued legislative
sanction that it was so greatly expanded. The
poverty of Ireland, the low state of civilization of a large
proportion of its inhabitants, the effects of the civil wars
which had so recently convulsed it, and the exclusion of its
products from the English Colonies, were doubtless great
obstacles to manufacturing enterprise; but, on the other
hand, Irish wool was very good, living was cheaper, taxes
were lighter than in England, a spirit of real industrial
energy began to pervade the country, and a considerable
number of English manufacturers came over to colonize it.
There appeared for a time every probability that the Irish
would become an industrial nation, and, had manufactures
arisen, their whole social, political, and economical condition
would have been changed. But English jealousy again
interposed. By an Act of crushing and unprecedented
severity, which was introduced in 1698 and carried in 1699,
<!-- Page 170 --><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170" />the export of the Irish woollen manufactures, not only to
England, but also to all other countries, was absolutely
forbidden.</p>

<p>&quot;The effects of this measure were terrible almost beyond
conception. The main industry of the country was at a
blow completely and irretrievably annihilated. A vast
population was thrown into a condition of utter destitution.
Several thousands of manufacturers left the country, and
carried their skill and enterprise to Germany, France, and
Spain. The western and southern districts of Ireland are
said to have been nearly depopulated. Emigration to
America began on a large scale, and the blow was so severe
that long after, a kind of chronic famine prevailed.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33" /><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Lecky relates with pride how the penal code was
relaxed, and the commercial restrictions were removed,
while the Irish Parliament, essentially a Protestant and
landlord body, still existed, and shows how the cause of
Catholic Emancipation was retarded by the Union.</p>

<p>&quot;The Relief Bill of '93 naturally suggests a consideration
of the question so often agitated in Ireland, whether the
Union was really a benefit to the Roman Catholic cause.
It has been argued that Catholic Emancipation was an impossibility
as long as the Irish Parliament lasted; for in a
country where the great majority were Roman Catholics, it
would be folly to expect the members of the dominant
creed to surrender a monopoly on which their ascendency
depended. The arguments against this view are, I believe,
overwhelming. The injustice of the disqualification was
far more striking before the Union than after it. In the
one case, the Roman Catholics were excluded from the
Parliament of a nation of which they were the great majority;
in the other, they were excluded from the Parliament of an
empire in which they were a small minority. Grattan, Plunket,
Curran, Burrowes, and Ponsonby were the great supporters of
<!-- Page 171 --><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171" />Catholic Emancipation, and the great opponents of the Union.
Clare and Duigenan were the two great opponents of
emancipation, and the great supporters of the Union. At
a time when scarcely any public opinion existed in Ireland,
when the Roman Catholics were nearly quiescent, and
when the leaning of Government was generally liberal, the
Irish Protestants admitted their fellow-subjects to the
magistracy, to the jury-box, and to the franchise. By
this last measure they gave them an amount of political
power which necessarily implied complete emancipation.
Even if no leader of genius had arisen in the Roman
Catholic ranks, and if no spirit of enthusiasm had animated
their councils, the influence possessed by a body who
formed three fourths of the population, who were rapidly
rising in wealth, and who could send their representatives
to Parliament, would have been sufficient to ensure their
triumph. If the Irish Legislature had continued, it would
have been found impossible to resist the demand for reform;
and every reform, by diminishing the overgrown power of a
few Protestant landholders, would have increased that of the
Roman Catholics. The concession accorded in 1793 was,
in fact, far greater and more important than that accorded
in 1829, and it placed the Roman Catholics, in a great
measure, above the mercy of Protestants. But this was not
all. The sympathies of the Protestants were being rapidly
enlisted in their behalf. The generation to which Charlemont
and Flood belonged had passed away, and all the
leading intellects of the country, almost all the Opposition,
and several conspicuous members of the Government, were
warmly in favour of emancipation. The rancour which at
present exists between the members of the two creeds
appears then to have been almost unknown, and the real
obstacle to emancipation was not the feelings of the people,
but the policy of the Government. The Bar may be considered
on most subjects a very fair exponent of the educated
<!-- Page 172 --><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172" />opinion of the nation; and Wolf Tone observed, in 1792,
that it was almost unanimous in favour of the Catholics;
and it is not without importance, as showing the tendencies
of the rising generation, that a large body of the
students of Dublin University in 1795 presented an address
to Grattan, thanking him for his labours in the cause. The
Roman Catholics were rapidly gaining the public opinion
of Ireland, when the Union arrayed against them another
public opinion which was deeply prejudiced against their
faith, and almost entirely removed from their influence.
Compare the twenty years before the Union with the
twenty years that followed it, and the change is sufficiently
manifest. There can scarcely be a question that if Lord
Fitzwilliam had remained in office the Irish Parliament would
readily have given emancipation. In the United Parliament
for many years it was obstinately rejected, and if O'Connell
had never arisen it would probably never have been granted
unqualified by the veto. In 1828 when the question was
brought forward in Parliament, sixty-one out of ninety-three
Irish members, forty-five out of sixty-one Irish county
members, voted in its favour. Year after year Grattan and
Plunket brought forward the case of their fellow-countrymen
with an eloquence and a perseverance worthy of their
great cause; but year after year they were defeated. It was
not till the great tribune had arisen, till he had moulded
his co-religionists into one compact and threatening mass,
and had brought the country to the verge of revolution,
that the tardy boon was conceded. Eloquence and argument
proved alike unavailing when unaccompanied by
menace, and Catholic Emancipation was confessedly granted
because to withhold it would be to produce a rebellion.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34" /><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Many people will think that this is a sufficiently weighty
condemnation of the Union, but what follows is a still
graver reflection on that untoward measure.<!-- Page 173 --><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173" /></p>

<p>&quot;In truth the harmonious co-operation of Ireland with
England depends much less upon the framework of the
institutions of the former country than upon the dispositions
of its people and upon the classes who guide its
political life. With a warm and loyal attachment to the
connection pervading the nation, the largest amount of self-government
might be safely conceded, and the most defective
political arrangement might prove innocuous. This is the
true cement of nations, and no change, however plausible
in theory, can be really advantageous which contributes to
diminish it. Theorists may argue that it would be better for
Ireland to become in every respect a province of England;
they may contend that a union of Legislatures, accompanied
by a corresponding fusion of characters and identification
of hopes, interests, and desires, would strengthen
the empire; but as a matter of fact this was not what was
effected in 1800. The measure of Pitt centralized, but it
did not unite, or rather, by uniting the Legislatures it
divided the nations. In a country where the sentiment
of nationality was as intense as in any part of Europe, it
destroyed the national Legislature contrary to the manifest
wish of the people, and by means so corrupt, treacherous,
and shameful that they are never likely to be forgotten.
In a country where, owing to the religious difference, it was
peculiarly necessary that a vigorous lay public opinion
should be fostered to dilute or restrain the sectarian spirit,
it suppressed the centre and organ of political life, directed
the energies of the community into the channels of sectarianism,
drove its humours inwards, and thus began a
perversion of public opinion which has almost destroyed
the elements of political progress. In a country where the
people have always been singularly destitute of self-reliance,
and at the same time eminently faithful to their leaders, it
withdrew the guidance of affairs from the hands of the
resident gentry, and, by breaking their power, prepared the
<!-- Page 174 --><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174" />ascendency of the demagogue or the rebel. In two plain
ways it was dangerous to the connection: it incalculably
increased the aggregate disloyalty of the people, and it
destroyed the political supremacy of the class that is
most attached to the connection. The Irish Parliament,
with all its faults, was an eminently loyal body. The Irish
people through the eighteenth century, in spite of great
provocations, were on the whole a loyal people till the recall
of Lord Fitzwilliam, and even then a few very moderate
measures of reform might have reclaimed them. Burke,
in his <i>Letters on a Regicide Peace</i>, when reviewing the
elements of strength on which England could confide in her
struggle with revolutionary France, placed in the very first
rank the co-operation of Ireland. At the present day, it
is to be feared that most impartial men would regard
Ireland, in the event of a great European war, rather as
a source of weakness than of strength. More than seventy
years have passed since the boasted measure of Pitt, and
it is unfortunately incontestable that the lower orders in
Ireland are as hostile to the system of government under
which they live as the Hungarian people have ever been to
Austrian, or the Roman to Papal rule; that Irish disloyalty is
multiplying enemies of England wherever the English tongue
is spoken; and that the national sentiment runs so strongly
that multitudes of Irish Catholics look back with deep
affection to the Irish Parliament, although no Catholic could
sit within its walls, and although it was only during the last
seven years of its independent existence that Catholics
could vote for its members. Among the opponents of the
Union were many of the most loyal, as well as nearly all
the ablest men in Ireland; and Lord Charlemont, who died
shortly before the measure was consummated, summed up
the feelings of many in the emphatic sentence with which
he protested against it. 'It would more than any other
measure,' he said, 'contribute to the separation of two
<!-- Page 175 --><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175" />countries the perpetual connection of which is one of the
warmest wishes of my heart.'</p>

<p>&quot;In fact, the Union of 1800 was not only a great crime,
but was also, like most crimes, a great blunder. The manner
in which it was carried was not only morally scandalous;
it also entirely vitiated it as a work of statesmanship. No
great political measure can be rationally judged upon its
abstract merits, and without considering the character and
the wishes of the people for whom it is intended. It is now
idle to discuss what might have been the effect of a Union
if it had been carried before 1782, when the Parliament
was still unemancipated; if it had been the result of a
spontaneous movement of public opinion; if it had been
accompanied by the emancipation of the Catholics. Carried
as it was prematurely, in defiance of the national sentiment
of the people and of the protests of the unbribed talent
of the country, it has deranged the whole course of political
development, driven a large proportion of the people into
sullen disloyalty, and almost destroyed healthy public
opinion. In comparing the abundance of political talent
in Ireland during the last century with the striking absence
of it at present, something no doubt may be attributed to
the absence of protection for literary property in Ireland
in the former period, which may have directed an unusual
portion of the national talent to politics, and something
to the Colonial and Indian careers which have of late years
been thrown open to competition; but when all due allowances
have been made for these, the contrast is sufficiently
impressive. Few impartial men can doubt that the tone
of political life and the standard of political talent have been
lowered, while sectarian animosity has been greatly increased,
and the extent to which Fenian principles have permeated
the people is a melancholy comment upon the prophesies
that the Union would put an end to disloyalty in Ireland.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35" /><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a><!-- Page 176 --><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176" /></p>

<p>Mr. Lecky's views as to what ought to have been
done in 1800 deserve to be set forth.</p>

<p>&quot;While, however, the Irish policy of Pitt appears to
be both morally and politically deserving of almost unmitigated
condemnation, I cannot agree with those who believe
that the arrangement of 1782 could have been permanent.
The Irish Parliament would doubtless have been in time reformed,
but it would have soon found its situation intolerable.
Imperial policy must necessarily have been settled by
the Imperial Parliament, in which Ireland had no voice; and,
unlike Canada or Australia, Ireland is profoundly affected by
every change of Imperial policy. Connection with England
was of overwhelming importance to the lesser country, while
the tie uniting them would have been found degrading by
one nation and inconvenient to the other. Under such
circumstances a Union of some kind was inevitable. It
was simply a question of time, and must have been demanded
by Irish opinion. At the same time, it would not,
I think, have been such a Union as that of 1800. The
conditions of Irish and English politics are so extremely
different, and the reasons for preserving in Ireland a local
centre of political life are so powerful, that it is probable
a Federal Union would have been preferred. Under such
a system the Irish Parliament would have continued to
exist, but would have been restricted to purely local subjects,
while an Imperial Parliament, in which Irish representatives
sat, would have directed the policy of the
empire.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36" /><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>MR. GOLDWIN SMITH.</p>

<p>None of the recent opponents of Home Rule have
written against that policy with more brilliance and epigrammatic
keenness than Mr. Goldwin Smith. But no one
<!-- Page 177 --><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177" />has stated with more force the facts and considerations
which, operating on men's mind for years past, have made
the Liberal party Home Rulers now. His <i>coup d'oeil</i>
remains the most pointed indictment ever drawn from the
historical annals of Ireland against the English methods
of governing that country. Twenty years ago he anticipated
the advice recently given by Mr. Gladstone. In 1867 he
wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;I have myself sought and found in the study of Irish
history the explanation of the paradox, that a people with so
many gifts, so amiable, naturally so submissive to rulers, and
everywhere but in their own country industrious, are in
their own country bywords of idleness, lawlessness, disaffection,
and agrarian crime.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37" /><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> He explains the paradox thus:
&quot;But it is difficult to distinguish the faults of the Irish from
their misfortunes. It has been well said of their past industrial
character and history,&mdash;'We were reckless, ignorant,
improvident, drunken, and idle. We were idle, for we had
nothing to do; we were reckless, for we had no hope; we
were ignorant, for learning was denied us; we were improvident,
for we had no future; we were drunken, for we
sought to forget our misery. That time has passed away
for ever.' No part of this defence is probably more true
than that which connects the drunkenness of the Irish
people with their misery. Drunkenness is, generally speaking,
the vice of despair; and it springs from the despair of
the Irish peasant as rankly as from that of his English fellow.
The sums of money which have lately been transmitted by
Irish emigrants to their friends in Ireland seem a conclusive
answer to much loose denunciation of the national character,
both in a moral and an industrial point of view.... There
seems no good reason for believing that the Irish Kelts are
averse to labour, provided they be placed, as people of all
races require to be placed, for two or three generations in
<!-- Page 178 --><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178" />circumstances favourable to industry.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38" /><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> He shows that
the Irish have not been so placed. &quot;Still more does
justice require that allowance should be made on historical
grounds for the failings of the Irish people. If they are
wanting in industry, in regard for the rights of property, in
reverence for the law, history furnishes a full explanation
of their defects, without supposing in them any inherent
depravity, or even any inherent weakness. They have
never had the advantage of the training through which
other nations have passed in their gradual rise from barbarism
to civilization. The progress of the Irish people
was arrested at almost a primitive stage, and a series of
calamities, following close upon each other, have prevented
it from ever fairly resuming its course. The pressure of
overwhelming misery has now been reduced; government
has become mild and just; the civilizing agency of education
has been introduced; the upper classes are rapidly returning
to their duty, and the natural effect is at once seen
in the improved character of the people. Statesmen are
bound to be well acquainted with the historical sources
of the evil with which they have to deal, especially when
those evils are of such a nature as, at first aspect, to imply
depravity in a nation. There are still speakers and writers
who seem to think that the Irish are incurably vicious,
because the accumulated effects of so many centuries
cannot be removed at once by a wave of the legislator's
wand. Some still believe, or affect to believe, that the
very air of the island is destructive of the characters and
understandings of all who breathe it.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39" /><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>Elsewhere he adds, referring to the land system:</p>

<p>&quot;How many centuries of a widely different training
have the English people gone through in order to acquire
their boasted love of law.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40" /><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p><!-- Page 179 --><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179" />Of the &quot;training&quot; through which the Irish went, he
says&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;The existing settlement of land in Ireland, whether
dating from the confiscations of the Stuarts, or from
those of Cromwell, rests on a proscription three or four
times as long as that on which the settlement of land
rests over a considerable part of France. It may, therefore,
be considered as placed upon discussion in the estimation
of all sane men; and, this being the case, it is safe to
observe that no inherent want of respect for property is
shown by the Irish people if a proprietorship which had its
origin within historical memory in flagrant wrong is less
sacred in their eyes than it would be if it had its origin in
immemorial right.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41" /><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>The character which he gives of Irish landlordism
deserves to be quoted:</p>

<p>&quot;The Cromwellian landowners soon lost their religious
character, while they retained all the hardness of the fanatic
and the feelings of Puritan conquerors towards a conquered
Catholic people. 'I have eaten with them,' said one, 'drunk
with them, fought with them; but I never prayed with them.'
Their descendants became, probably, the very worst upper
class with which a country was ever afflicted. The habits of
the Irish gentry grew beyond measure brutal and reckless, and
the coarseness of their debaucheries would have disgusted
the crew of Comus. Their drunkenness, their blasphemy,
their ferocious duelling, left the squires of England far
behind. If there was a grotesque side to their vices which
mingles laughter with our reprobation, this did not render
their influence less pestilent to the community of which the
motive of destiny had made them social chiefs. Fortunately,
their recklessness was sure, in the end, to work, to
a certain extent, its own cure; and in the background of
<!-- Page 180 --><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180" />their swinish and uproarious drinking-bouts, the Encumbered
Estates Act rises to our view.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42" /><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Goldwin Smith deals with agrarian crime thus:</p>

<p>&quot;The atrocities perpetrated by the Whiteboys, especially
in the earlier period of agrarianism (for they afterwards grew
somewhat less inhuman), are such as to make the flesh creep.
No language can be too strong in speaking of the horrors of
such a state of society. But it would be unjust to confound
these agrarian conspiracies with ordinary crime, or to suppose
that they imply a propensity to ordinary crime either
on the part of those who commit them, or on the part of the
people who connive at and favour their commission. In
the districts where agrarian conspiracy and outrage were
most rife, the number of ordinary crimes was very small.
In Munster, in 1833, out of 973 crimes, 627 were Whiteboy,
or agrarian, and even of the remainder, many, being crimes
of violence, were probably committed from the same motive.</p>

<p>&quot;In plain truth, the secret tribunals which administered
the Whiteboy code were to the people the organs of a wild
law of social morality by which, on the whole, the interest
of the peasant was protected. They were not regular
tribunals; neither were the secret tribunals of Germany in
the Middle Ages, the existence of which, and the submission
of the people to their jurisdiction, implied the
presence of much violence, but not of much depravity, considering
the wildness of the times. The Whiteboys 'found
in their favour already existing a general and settled hatred
of the law among the great body of the peasantry.'<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43" /><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> We
have seen how much the law, and the ministers of the law,
had done to deserve the peasant's love. We have seen,
too, in what successive guises property had presented itself
to his mind: first as open rapine; then as robbery carried
on through the roguish technicalities of an alien code; finally
<!-- Page 181 --><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181" />as legalized and systematic oppression. Was it possible
that he should have formed so affectionate a reverence
either for law or property as would be proof against the
pressure of starvation?&quot;<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44" /><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> &quot;A people cannot be expected
to love and reverence oppression because it is consigned to
the statute-book, and called law.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45" /><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>These extracts are taken from <i>Irish History and Irish
Character</i>, which was published in 1861. But in 1867 Mr.
Goldwin Smith wrote a series of letters to the <i>Daily News</i>,
which were republished in 1868 under the title of <i>The Irish
Question</i>; and these letters form, perhaps, the most statesmanlike
and far-seeing pronouncement that has ever been
made on the Irish difficulty.</p>

<p>In the preface Mr. Goldwin Smith begins:</p>

<p>&quot;The Irish legislation of the last forty years, notwithstanding
the adoption of some remedial measures, has failed
through the indifference of Parliament to the sentiments
of Irishmen; and the harshness of English public opinion
has embittered the effects on Irish feeling of the indifference
of Parliament. Occasionally a serious effort has been made
by an English statesman to induce Parliament to approach
Irish questions in that spirit of sympathy, and with that
anxious desire to be just, without which a Parliament in
London cannot legislate wisely for Ireland. Such efforts
have hitherto met with no response; is it too much to hope
that it will be otherwise in the year now opening?&quot;<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46" /><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>The only comment I shall make on these words is: they
were penned more than half a century after Mr. Pitt's
Union, which was to shower down blessings on the Irish
people.</p>

<p>Mr. Goldwin Smith's first letter was written on the 23rd of
November, 1867, the day of the execution of the Fenians
Allen, Larkin, and O'Brien. He says&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;<!-- Page 182 --><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182" />There can be no doubt, I apprehend, that the Irish
difficulty has entered on a new phase, and that Irish disaffection
has, to repeat an expression which I heard used in Ireland,
come fairly into a line with the other discontented nationalities
of Europe. Active Fenianism probably pervades only
the lowest class; passive sympathy, which the success of the
movement would at once convert into active co-operation,
extends, it is to be feared, a good deal higher.</p>

<p>&quot;England has ruin before her, unless she can hit on a
remedy, and overcome any obstacles of class interest or of
national pride which would prevent its application, the part
of Russia in Poland, or of Austria in Italy&mdash;a part cruel,
hateful, demoralizing, contrary to all our high principles and
professions, and fraught with dangers to our own freedom.
Our position will be worse than that of Russia in this
respect, that, while her Poland is only a province, our
Fenianism is an element pervading every city of the United
Kingdom in which Irish abound, and allying itself with
kindred misery, discontent, and disorder. Wretchedness,
the result of misgovernment, has caused the Irish people to
multiply with the recklessness of despair, and now here are
their avenging hosts in the midst of us, here is the poison of
their disaffection running through every member of our
social frame. Not only so, but the same wretchedness has
sent millions of emigrants to form an Irish nation in the
United States, where the Irish are a great political power,
swaying by their votes the councils of the American
Republic, and in immediate contact with those Transatlantic
possessions of England, the retention of which
it is now patriotic to applaud, and will one day be patriotic
to have dissuaded.</p>

<p>&quot; ... That Ireland is not at this moment, materially
speaking, in a particularly suffering state, but, on the contrary,
the farmers are rather prosperous, and wages, even
when allowance is made for the rise in the price of provi<!-- Page 183 --><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183" />sions,
considerably higher than they were, only adds to the
significance of this widespread disaffection.</p>

<p>&quot;The Fenian movement is not religious, nor radically
economical (though no doubt it has in it a socialistic
element), but national, and the remedy for it must be one
which cures national discontent. This is the great truth
which the English people have to lay to heart.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47" /><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Goldwin Smith then dispels the notion that the Irish
question is a religious one.</p>

<p>&quot;When Fenianism first appeared, the Orangemen, in
accordance with their fixed idea, ascribed it to the priests.
They were undeceived, I was told, by seeing a priest run
away from the Fenians in fear of his life.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48" /><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>Neither was it a question of the land.</p>

<p>&quot;The land question, no doubt, lies nearer to the heart
of the matter, and it is the great key to Irish history in
the past; but I do not believe that even this is fundamental.&quot;</p>

<p>He then states what is &quot;fundamental.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49" /><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>&quot;The real root of the disaffection which exhibits itself at
present in the guise of Fenianism, and which has been
suddenly kindled into flame by the arming of the Irish in
the American civil war, but which existed before in a
nameless and smouldering state, is, as I believe, the want of
national institutions, of a national capital, of any objects
of national reverence and attachment, and consequently of
anything deserving to be called national life. The English
Crown and Parliament the Irish have never learnt, nor have
they had any chance of learning, to love, or to regard as
national, notwithstanding the share which was given them,
too late, in the representation. The greatness of England
is nothing to them. Her history is nothing, or worse. The
success of Irishmen in London consoles the Irish in
Ireland no more than the success of Italian adventurers in
<!-- Page 184 --><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184" />foreign countries (which was very remarkable) consoled the
Italian people. The drawing off of Irish talent, in fact,
turns to an additional grievance in their minds. Dublin is
a modern Tara, a metropolis from which the glory has
departed; and the viceroyalty, though it pleases some of
the tradesmen, fails altogether to satisfy the people. 'In
Ireland we can make no appeal to patriotism, we can have
no patriotic sentiments in our schoolbooks, no patriotic
emblems in our schools, because in Ireland everything
patriotic is rebellious.' These were the words uttered in
my hearing, not by a complaining demagogue, but by a
desponding statesman. They seemed to me pregnant with
fatal truths.</p>

<p>&quot;If the craving for national institutions, and the disaffection
bred in this void of the Irish people's heart, seem to us
irrational and even insane, in the absence of any more
substantial grievance, we ought to ask ourselves what
would become of our own patriotism if we had no national
institutions, no objects of national loyalty and reverence,
even though we might be pretty well governed, at least in
intention, by a neighbouring people whom we regarded as
aliens, and who, in fact, regarded us pretty much in the
same light. Let us first judge ourselves fairly, and then
judge the Irish, remembering always that they are more
imaginative and sentimental, and need some centre of
national feeling and affection more than ourselves.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50" /><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>And all this was written sixty-seven years after the
Union of 1800.</p>

<p>Mr. Goldwin Smith then deals with the subject of the
Irish and Scotch unions much in the same way as Mr.
Lecky.</p>

<p>&quot;The incorporation of the Scotch nation with the
English, being conducted on the right principles by the
great Whig statesman of Anne, has been perfectly success<!-- Page 185 --><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185" />ful.
The attempt to incorporate the Irish nation with the
English and Scotch, the success of which would have been,
if possible, a still greater blessing, being conducted by very
different people and on very different principles, has unhappily
failed. What might have been the result if even the
Hanoverian sovereigns had done the personal duty to their
Irish kingdom which they have unfortunately neglected, it
is now too late to inquire. The Irish Union has missed its
port, and, in order to reach it, will have to tack again. We
may hold down a dependency, of course, by force, in
Russian and Austrian fashion; but force will never make
the hearts of two nations one, especially when they are
divided by the sea. Once get rid of this deadly international
hatred, and there will be hope of real union in
the future.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51" /><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Goldwin Smith finally proposes a &quot;plan&quot; by which
the &quot;deadly international hatred&quot; might be got rid of, and
a &quot;real union&quot; brought about. Here it is.</p>

<p>&quot;1. The residence of the Court at Dublin, not merely
to gratify the popular love of royalty and its pageantries,
which no man of sense desires to stimulate, but to assure
the Irish people, in the only way possible as regards the
mass of them, that the sovereign of the United Kingdom is
really their sovereign, and that they are equally cared for
and honoured with the other subjects of the realm. This
would also tend to make Dublin a real capital, and to
gather and retain there a portion of the Irish talent which
now seeks its fortune elsewhere.</p>

<p>&quot;2. An occasional session (say once in every three years)
of the Imperial Parliament in Dublin, partly for the same
purposes as the last proposal, but also because the circumstances
of Ireland are likely to be, for some time at least,
really peculiar, and the personal acquaintance of our legislators
with them is the only sufficient security for good Irish
<!-- Page 186 --><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186" />legislation. There could be no serious difficulty in holding
a short session in the Irish capital, where there is plenty of
accommodation for both Houses.</p>

<p>&quot;3. A liberal measure of local self-government for
Ireland. I would not vest the power in any single assembly
for all Ireland, because Ulster is really a different country
from the other provinces. I would give each province a
council of its own, and empower that council to legislate
(subject, of course, to the supremacy of the Imperial Parliament)
on all matters not essential to the political and
legal unity of the empire, in which I would include local
education. The provincial councils should of course be
elective, and the register of electors might be the same as
that of electors to the Imperial Parliament. In England
itself the extension of local institutions, as political training
schools for the masses, as checks upon the sweeping action
of the great central assembly, and as the best organs of
legislation in all matters requiring (as popular education,
among others, does) adaptation to the circumstances of particular
districts, would, I think, have formed a part of any
statesmanlike revision of our political system. Here, also,
much good might be done, and much evil averted, by committing
the present business of quarter sessions, other than
the judicial business, together with such other matters as
the central legislative might think fit to vest in local hands,
to an assembly elected by the county.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52" /><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>Thus it will be seen that twenty years ago Mr. Goldwin
Smith anticipated Mr. Chamberlain's scheme of provincial
councils, and got a good way on the road to an Irish
Parliament.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>MR. DICEY.</p>

<p>A fairer controversalist, or an abler supporter of the
&quot;paper Union,&quot; than Mr. Dicey there is not; nevertheless
<!-- Page 187 --><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187" />no man has fired more effective shots into Mr. Pitt's
unfortunate arrangement of 1800.</p>

<p>How well has the &quot;failure&quot; of that arrangement been
described in these pithy sentences&mdash;&quot;Eighty-six years have
elapsed since the conclusion of the Treaty of Union between
England and Ireland. The two countries do not yet form
an united nation. The Irish people are, if not more
wretched (for the whole European world has made progress,
and Ireland with it), yet more conscious of wretchedness,
and Irish disaffection to England is, if not deeper, more
widespread than in 1800. An Act meant by its authors to
be a source of the prosperity and concord which, though
slowly, followed upon the Union with Scotland, has not
made Ireland rich, has not put an end to Irish lawlessness,
has not terminated the feud between Protestants and
Catholics, has not raised the position of Irish tenants, has
not taken away the causes of Irish discontent, and has,
therefore, not removed Irish disloyalty. This is the indictment
which can fairly be brought against the Act of
Union.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53" /><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>What follows reflects honour on Mr. Dicey as an honest
opponent who does not shrink from facts; but what
a wholesale condemnation of the policy of the Imperial
Parliament!</p>

<p>&quot;On one point alone (it may be urged) all men, of whatever
party or of whatever nation, who have seriously studied the
annals of Ireland are agreed&mdash;the history is a record of incessant
failure on the part of the Government, and of incessant
misery on the part of the people. On this matter, if on no
other, De Beaumont, Froude, and Lecky are at one. As to
the guilt of the failure or the cause of the misery, men may
and do differ; that England, whether from her own fault
or the fault of the Irish people, or from perversity of circumstances,
has failed in Ireland of achieving the elemen<!-- Page 188 --><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188" />tary
results of good government is as certain as any fact of
history or of experience. Every scheme has been tried in
turn, and no scheme has succeeded or has even, it may be
suggested, produced its natural effects. Oppression of the
Catholics has increased the adherents and strengthened the
hold of Catholicism. Protestant supremacy, while it lasted,
did not lead even to Protestant contentment, and the one
successful act of resistance to the English dominion was
effected by a Protestant Parliament supported by an army
of volunteers, led by a body of Protestant officers. The
independence gained by a Protestant Parliament led, after
eighteen years, to a rebellion so reckless and savage that it
caused, if it did not justify, the destruction of the Parliament
and the carrying of the Union. The Act of Union did not
lead to national unity, and a measure which appeared on
the face of it (though the appearance, it must be admitted,
was delusive) to be a copy of the law which bound England
and Scotland into a common country inspired by common
patriotism, produced conspiracy and agitation, and at last
placed England and Ireland further apart, morally, than
they stood at the beginning of the century. The Treaty of
Union, it was supposed, missed its mark because it was not
combined with Catholic Emancipation. The Catholics were
emancipated, but emancipation, instead of producing
loyalty, brought forth the cry for repeal. The Repeal movement
ended in failure, but its death gave birth to the
attempted rebellion in 1848. Suppressed rebellion begot
Fenianism, to be followed in its turn by the agitation for
Home Rule. The movement relies, it is said, and there is
truth in the assertion, on constitutional methods for obtaining
redress. But constitutional measures are supplemented by
boycotting, by obstruction, by the use of dynamite. A
century of reform has given us Mr. Parnell instead of
Grattan, and it is more than possible that Mr. Parnell may
be succeeded by leaders in whose eyes Mr. Davitt's policy
<!-- Page 189 --><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189" />may appear to be tainted with moderation. No doubt, in
each case the failure of good measures admits, like every
calamity in public or private life, of explanation, and after
the event it is easy to see why, for example, the Poor Law,
when extended to Ireland, did not produce even the good
effects such as they are which in England are to be set against
its numerous evils; or why an emigration of unparalleled
proportions has diminished population without much diminishing
poverty; why the disestablishment of the Anglican
Church has increased rather than diminished the hostility to
England of the Catholic priesthood; or why two Land Acts
have not contented Irish farmers. It is easy enough, in
short, and this without having any recourse to theory of
race, and without attributing to Ireland either more or less
of original sin than falls to the lot of humanity, to see how
it is that imperfect statesmanship&mdash;and all statesmanship, it
should be remembered, is imperfect&mdash;has failed in obtaining
good results at all commensurate with its generally good
intentions. Failure, however, is none the less failure because
its causes admit of analysis. It is no defence to
bankruptcy that an insolvent can, when brought before the
Court, lucidly explain the errors which resulted in disastrous
speculations. The failure of English statesmanship, explain
it as you will, has produced the one last and greatest evil
which misgovernment can cause. It has created hostility to
the law in the minds of the people. The law cannot work
in Ireland because the classes whose opinion in other
countries supports the actions of the courts, are in Ireland,
even when not law-breakers, in full sympathy with law-breakers.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54" /><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>No Home Ruler has described the evils of English misrule
in Ireland with such vigour as this.</p>

<p>&quot;Bad administration, religious persecution, above all, a
thoroughly vicious land tenure, accompanied by such sweep<!-- Page 190 --><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190" />ing
confiscations as to make it, at any rate, a plausible assertion
that all land in Ireland has during the course of Irish history
been confiscated at least thrice over, are admittedly some of
the causes, if they do not constitute the whole cause, of the one
immediate difficulty which perplexes the policy of England.
This is nothing else than the admitted disaffection to the
law of the land prevailing among large numbers of Irish
people. The existence of this disaffection, whatever be the
inference to be drawn from it, is undeniable. A series of
so-called Coercion Acts, passed both before and since the
Act of Union, give undeniable evidence, if evidence were
wanted, of the ceaseless and, as it would appear, almost
irrepressible resistance in Ireland offered by the people
to the enforcement of the law. I have not the remotest
inclination to underrate the lasting and formidable character
of this opposition between opinion and law, nor can any
jurist who wishes to deal seriously with a serious and
infinitely painful topic, question for a moment that the
ultimate strength of law lies in the sympathy, or at the
lowest the acquiescence, of the mass of the population.
Judges, constables, and troops become almost powerless
when the conscience of the people permanently opposes
the execution of the law. Severity produces either no effect
or bad effects; executed criminals are regarded as heroes
or martyrs; and jurymen and witnesses meet with the
execration and often with the fate of criminals. On such
a point it is best to take the opinion of a foreigner unaffected
by prejudices or passions from which no Englishman
or Irishman has a right to suppose himself free.</p>

<p>The next passage is a trenchant condemnation of the
&quot;Union.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There exists in Europe no country so completely at
unity with itself as Great Britain. Fifty years of reform
have done their work, and have removed the discontents,
the divisions, the disaffection, and the conspiracies which
marked the first quarter, or the first half of this century.
Great Britain, if left to herself, could act with all the force,
consistency, and energy given by unity of sentiment and
community of interests. The distraction and the uncertainty
of our political aims, the feebleness and inconsistency
with which they are pursued, arise, in part at least, from
the connection with Ireland. Neither Englishmen nor Irishmen
are to blame for the fact that it is difficult for communities
differing in historical associations and in political
conceptions to keep step together in the path of progress.
For other evils arising from the connection the blame must
rest on English Statesmen. All the inherent vices of party
government, all the weaknesses of the parliamentary system,
all the evils arising from the perverse notion that reform
ought always to be preceded by a period of lengthy and
more than half factitious agitation met by equally factitious
resistance, have been fostered and increased by the interaction
of Irish and English politics. No one can believe
that the inveterate habit of ruling one part of the United
<!-- Page 192 --><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192" />Kingdom on principles which no one would venture to
apply to the government of any other part of it, can have
produced anything but the most injurious effect on the
stability of our Government and the character of our public
men. The advocates of Home Rule find by far their
strongest arguments for influencing English opinion, in the
proofs which they produce that England, no less than
Ireland, has suffered from a political arrangement under
which legal union has failed to secure moral union.
<i>These arguments, whatever their strength, are, however, it
must be noted, more available to a Nationalist than to an
advocate of federalism</i>.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56" /><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>The words which I have italicised are an expression of
opinion; but nothing can alter the damning statement of
fact&mdash;&quot;legal union has failed to secure moral union.&quot; Nevertheless,
Mr. Dicey advocates the maintenance of this legal
union as it stands.</p>

<p>&quot;On the whole, then, it appears that, whatever changes
or calamities the future may have in store, the maintenance
of the Union is at this day the one sound policy for England
to pursue. It is sound because it is expedient; it is sound
because it is just.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57" /><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I shall not discuss the question of Home Rule with the
eminent writers whose works I have cited. It is enough
that they demonstrate the failure of the Union. So convinced
was Mr. Lecky, in 1871, of its failure, that he
suggested a readjustment of the relations of the two countries
on a federal basis;<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58" /><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and Mr. Goldwin Smith, in 1868, contended
that the Irish difficulty could only be settled by the
establishment of Provincial Councils, and an occasional
<!-- Page 193 --><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193" />session of the Imperial Parliament in Dublin. Mr. Dicey
clings to the existing Union while demonstrating its failure,
because he has persuaded himself that the only alternative
is separation.</p>

<p>Irishmen may be pardoned for acting on Mr. Dicey's
facts, and disregarding his prophecies. The mass of Irishmen
believe, with Grattan, that the ocean protests against
separation as the sea protests against such a union as was
attempted in 1800.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59" /><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>Ireland is a component member of the most complex
political body the world has yet known; any inquiry, then,
into the fitness of any particular form of government for
that country involves an investigation of the structures of
various composite nations, or nations made up of numerous
political communities more or less differing from each other.
From the examination of the nature of the common tie, and
the circumstances which caused it to be adopted or imposed
on the component peoples, we cannot but derive instruction,
and be furnished with materials which will enable us to take
a wide view of the question of Home Rule, and assist us in
judging between the various remedies proposed for the cure
of Irish disorders.</p>

<p>The nature of the ties which bind, or have bound, the
principal composite nations of the world together may be
classified as&mdash;</p>

<p>
1. Confederate unions.<br />
2. Federal unions.<br />
3. Imperial unions.<br />
</p>

<p>A confederate union may be defined to mean an alliance
between the governments of independent States, which
agree to appoint a common superior authority having power
<!-- Page 195 --><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195" />to make peace and war and to demand contributions of men
and money from the confederate States. Such superior
authority has no power of enforcing its decrees except
through the medium of the governments of the constituent
States; or, in other words, in case of disobedience, by
armed force.</p>

<p>A federal union differs from a confederate union in the
material fact that the common superior authority, instead
of acting on the individual subjects of the constituent States
through the medium of their respective governments, has a
power, in respect of all matters within its jurisdiction, of
enacting laws and issuing orders which are binding directly
on the individual citizens.</p>

<p>The distinguishing characteristics of an imperial union
are, that it consists of an aggregate of communities, one of
which is dominant, and that the component communities
have been brought into association, not by arrangement
between themselves, but by colonization, cession, and by
other means emanating from the resources or power of the
dominant community.</p>

<p>The above-mentioned distinction between a Government
having communities only for its subjects, and incapable
of enforcing its orders by any other means than
war, and a Government acting directly on individuals, must
be constantly borne in mind, for in this lies the whole
difference between a confederate and federal union; that is
to say, between a confederacy which, in the case of the
United States, lasted a few short years, and a federal union
which, with the same people as subjects, has lasted nearly
a century, and has stood the strain of the most terrible war
of modern times.</p>

<p>The material features of the Constitution of the United
States have been explained in a previous article.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61" /><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> All that
<!-- Page 196 --><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196" />is necessary to call to mind here is, that the Government of
the United States exercises a power of taxation throughout
the whole Union by means of its own officers, and enforces
its decrees through the medium of its own Courts. A
Supreme Court has also been established, which has power
to adjudicate on the constitutionality of all laws passed by
the Legislature of the United States, or of any State, and to
decide on all international questions.</p>

<p>Switzerland was till 1848 an example of a confederate
union or league of semi-independent States, which, unlike
other confederacies, had existed with partial interruptions
for centuries. This unusual vitality is attributed by Mill<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62" /><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
to the circumstance that the confederate government felt
its weakness so strongly that it hardly ever attempted to
exercise any real authority. Its present government, finally
settled in 1874, but based on fundamental laws passed in
1848, is a federal union formed on the pattern of the
American Constitution. It consists of a federal assembly
comprising two Chambers&mdash;the Upper Chamber composed
of forty-four members chosen by the twenty-two cantons,
two for each canton; the Lower consisting of 145 members
chosen by direct election at the rate of one deputy for every
20,000 persons. The chief executive authority is deputed
to a federal council consisting of seven members elected for
three years by the federal assembly, and having at their
head a president and vice-president, who are the first
magistrates of the republic. There is also a federal tribunal,
having similar functions to those of the supreme court
of the United States of America, consisting of nine members
elected for six years by the federal assembly.</p>

<p>The Empire of Germany is a federal union, differing
from the United States and Switzerland in having an hereditary
emperor as its head. It comprises twenty-six States,
who have &quot;formed an eternal union for the protection of
<!-- Page 197 --><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197" />the realm, and the care of the welfare of the German
people.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63" /><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> The King of Prussia, under the title of German
Emperor, represents the empire in all its relations to foreign
nations, and has the power of making peace and war, but
if the war be more than a defensive war he must have
the assent of the Upper House. The legislative body of
the empire consists of two Houses&mdash;the Upper, called the
Bundesrath, representing the several component States in
different proportions according to their relative importance;
the lower, the Reichstag, elected by the voters in 397
electoral districts, which are distributed amongst the constituent
States in unequal numbers, regard being had to the
population and circumstances of each State.</p>

<p>The Austro-Hungarian Empire is a federal union, differing
alike in its origin and construction from the federal
unions above mentioned. In the beginning Austria and
Hungary were independent countries&mdash;Austria a despotism,
Hungary a constitutional monarchy, with ancient laws and
customs dating back to the foundation of the kingdom in
895. In the sixteenth century the supreme power in both
countries&mdash;that is to say, the despotic monarchy in Austria
and the constitutional monarchy in Hungary&mdash;became
vested in the same person; as might have been anticipated,
the union was not a happy one. If we dip into Heeren's
<i>Political System of Europe</i> at intervals selected almost
at random, the following notices will be found in relation to
Austria and Hungary:&mdash;Between 1671 and 1700 &quot;political
unity in the Austrian monarchy was to have been enforced
especially in the principal country (Hungary), for this was
regarded as the sole method of establishing power; the
consequence was an almost perpetual revolutionary state of
affairs.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64" /><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Again, in the next chapter, commenting on the
period between 1740 and 1786: &quot;Hungary, in fact the
<!-- Page 198 --><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198" />chief, was treated like a conquered province; subjected to
the most oppressive commercial restraints, it was regarded
as a colony from which Austria exacted what she could for
her own advantage. The injurious consequences of this
internal discord are evident.&quot; Coming to modern times we
find that oppression followed oppression with sickening
monotony, and that at last the determination of Austria to
stamp out the Constitution in Hungary gave rise to the
insurrection of 1849, which Austria suppressed with the
assistance of Russia, and as a penalty declared the Hungarian
Constitution to be forfeited, and thereupon Hungary
was incorporated with Austria, as Ireland was incorporated
with Great Britain in 1800. Both events were the consequences
of unsuccessful rebellions; but the junction which,
in the case of Hungary, was enforced by the sword, was in
Ireland more smoothly carried into effect by corruption.
Hungary, sullen and discontented, waited for Austria's
calamity as her opportunity, and it came after the battle of
Sadowa. Austria had just emerged from a fearful conflict,
and Count Beust<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65" /><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> felt that unless some resolute effort was
made to meet the views of the constitutional party in Hungary,
the dismemberment of the empire must be the result.
Now, what was the course he took? Was it a tightening of
the bonds between Austria and Hungary? On the contrary,
to maintain the unity of the empire he dissolved its union
and restored to Hungary its ancient constitutional privileges.
Austria and Hungary each had its own Parliament for local
purposes. To manage the imperial concerns of peace and
war, and the foreign relations, a controlling body, called the
Delegations, was established, consisting of 120 members, of
whom half represent and are chosen by the Legislature of
Austria, and the other half by that of Hungary; the Upper
House of each country returning twenty members, and the
Lower House forty.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66" /><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Ordinarily the delegates sit and vote
<!-- Page 199 --><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199" />in two Chambers, but if they disagree the two branches
must meet together and give their final vote without debate,
which is binding on the whole empire.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67" /><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>The question arises, What is the magnetic influence
which induces communities of men to combine together in
federal unions? Undoubtedly it is the feeling of nationality;
and what is nationality? Mr. Mill says,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68" /><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> &quot;a portion of
mankind may be said to constitute a nationality if they are
united among themselves by common sympathies which do
not exist between them and any others; which make them
co-operate with each other more willingly than other people;
desire to be under the same government, and desire that it
should be a government by themselves or a portion of themselves
exclusively.&quot; He then proceeds to state that the
feeling of nationality may have been generated by various
causes. Sometimes it is the identity of race and descent;
community of language and community of religion greatly
contribute to it; geographical limits are one of its causes;
but the strongest of all is identity of political antecedents:
the possession of a national history and consequent community
of recollections&mdash;collective pride and humiliation,
pleasure and regret&mdash;connected with the same incidents in
the past.</p>

<p>The only point to be noted further in reference to the
foregoing federal unions, is that the same feeling of nationality
which, in the United States, Switzerland, and the
German Empire, produced a closer legal bond of union,
in the case of Austria-Hungary operated to dissolve the
amalgamation formed in 1849 of the two States, and to
produce a federal union of States in place of a single State.</p>

<p>One conclusion seems to follow irresistibly from any
<!-- Page 200 --><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200" />review of the construction of the various States above
described: that the stability of a nation bears no relation
whatever to the legal compactness or homogeneity of its
component parts. Russia and France, the most compact
political societies in Europe, do not, to say the least, rest on
a firmer basis than Germany and Switzerland, the inhabitants
of which are subjected to the obligations of a double
nationality. Above all, no European nation, except Great
Britain, can for a moment bear comparison with the United
States in respect of the devotion of its people to their
Constitution.</p>

<p>An imperial union, though resembling somewhat in
outward form a federal union, differs altogether from it both
in principle and origin. Its essential characteristic is that
one community is absolutely dominant while all the others
are subordinate. In the case of a federal union independent
States have agreed to resign a portion of their powers to a
central Government for the sake of securing the common
safety. In an imperial union the dominant or imperial
State delegates to each constituent member of the union
such a portion of local government as the dominant State
considers the subordinate member entitled to, consistently
with the integrity of the empire. The British Empire
furnishes the best example of an imperial union now
existing in the world. Her Majesty, as common head, is
the one link which binds the empire together and connects
with each other every constituent member. The Indian
Empire and certain military dependencies require no
further notice in these pages; but a summary of our various
forms of colonial government is required to complete our
knowledge of the forms of Home Rule possibly applicable
to Ireland.</p>

<p>The colonies, in relation to their forms of government,
may be classified as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. Crown colonies, in which laws may be made by the<!-- Page 201 --><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201" />
Governor alone, or with the concurrence of a Council
nominated by the Crown.</p>

<p>2. Colonies possessing representative institutions, but
not responsible government, in which the Crown has only a
veto on legislation, but the Home Government retains the
control of the executive.</p>

<p>3. Colonies possessing representative institutions and
responsible government, in which the Crown has only a
veto on legislation, and the Home Government has no
control over any public officer except the Governor.</p>

<p>The British Colonial Governments thus present an
absolute gradation of rule; beginning with absolute
despotism and ending with almost absolute legal independence,
except in so far as a veto on legislation and the
presence of a Governor named by the Crown mark the
dependence of the colony on the mother country.</p>

<p>It is to be remembered, moreover, that the colonies
which have received this complete local freedom are the
great colonies of the earth&mdash;nations themselves possessing
territories as large or larger than any European State&mdash;namely,
Canada, the Cape, New South Wales, Victoria,
Queensland, South Australia, New Zealand, Tasmania.
And this change from dependence to freedom has been
effected with the good-will both of the mother country and
the colony, and without it being imputed to the colonists,
when desiring a larger measure of self-government, that
they were separatists, anarchists, or revolutionists.</p>

<p>Such are the general principles of colonial government,
but one colony requires special mention, from the circumstance
of its Constitution having been put forward as a
model for Ireland; this is the Dominion of Canada. The
Government of Canada is, in effect, a subordinate federal
union; that is to say, it possesses a central Legislature,
having the largest possible powers of local self-government
consistent with the supremacy of the empire, with seven
<!-- Page 202 --><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202" />inferior provincial Governments, exercising powers greater
than those of an English county, but not so great as those
of an American State. The advantage of such a form of
government is that, without weakening the supremacy of
the empire or of the central local power, it admits of considerable
diversities being made in the details of provincial
government, where local peculiarities and antecedents
render it undesirable to make a more complete assimilation
of the Governments of the various provinces.</p>

<p>Materials have now been collected which will enable
the reader to judge of the expediency or inexpediency of
the course taken by Mr. Gladstone's Government in dealing
with Ireland. Three alternatives were open to them&mdash;</p>

<p>
1. To let matters alone.<br />
2. To pass a Coercion Bill.<br />
3. To change the government of Ireland, and at<br />
the same time to pass a Land Bill.<br />
</p>

<p>The two last measures are combined under the head of
one alternative, as it will be shown in the sequel that no
effective Land Bill can be passed without granting Home
Rule in Ireland.</p>

<p>Now, the short answer to the first alternative is, that no
party in the State&mdash;Conservative, Whig, Radical, Unionist,
Home Ruler, Parnellite&mdash;thought it possible to leave things
alone. That something must be done was universally
admitted.</p>

<p>The second alternative has found favour with the
present Government, and certainly is a better example of
the triumph of hope over experience, than even the proverbial
second marriage.</p>

<p>Eighty-six years have elapsed since the Union. During
the first thirty-two years only eleven years, and during the
last fifty-four years only two years have been free from
special repressive legislation; yet the agitation for repeal of
the Union, and general discontent, are more violent in<!-- Page 203 --><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203" />
1887 than in any one of the eighty-six previous years. In
the name of common-sense, is there any reason for supposing
that the Coercion Bill of 1887 will have a better or
more enduring effect than its numerous predecessors? The
<i>prim&acirc; facie</i> case is at all events in favour of the contention
that, when so many trials of a certain remedy have failed, it
would be better not to try the same remedy again, but to
have recourse to some other medicine. What, then, was
the position of Mr. Gladstone's Government at the close of
the election of 1885? What were the considerations presented
to them as supreme supervisors and guardians of
the British Empire? They found that vast colonial empire
tranquil and loyal beyond previous expectation&mdash;the greater
colonies satisfied with their existing position; the lesser
expecting that as they grew up to manhood they would be
treated as men, and emancipated from childish restraints.
The Channel Islands and the Isle of Man were contented
with their sturdy dependent independence, loyal to the
backbone. One member only stood aloof, sulky and dissatisfied,
and though in law integrally united with the
dominant community, practically was dissociated from it by
forming within Parliament (the controlling body of the
whole) a separate section, of which the whole aim was to
fetter the action of the entire supreme body in order to
bring to an external severance the practical disunion which
existed between that member and Great Britain. This
member&mdash;Ireland&mdash;as compared with other parts of the
empire, was small and insignificant; measured against
Great Britain, its population was five millions to thirty-one
millions, and its estimated capital was only one twenty-fourth
part of the capital of the United Kingdom. Measured
against Australia, its trade with Great Britain was almost
insignificant. Its importance arose from the force of public
opinion in Great Britain, which deemed England pledged to
protect the party in Ireland which desired the Union to be
<!-- Page 204 --><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204" />maintained, and from the power of obstructing English
legislation through the medium of the Irish contingent,
willing and ready on every occasion to intervene in English
debates. The first step to be taken obviously was to find
out what the great majority of Irish members wanted. The
answer was, that they would be contented to quit the British
Parliament on having a Parliament established on College
Green, with full powers of local government, and that they
would accept on behalf of their country a certain fixed
annual sum to be paid to the Imperial Exchequer, on condition
that such sum should not be increased without the
consent of the Irish representatives. Here there were two
great points gained without any sacrifice of principle.
Ireland could not be said to be taxed without representation
when her representatives agreed to a certain fixed
sum to be paid till altered with their consent; while at the
same time all risk of obstruction to English legislation by
Irish means was removed by the proposal that the Irish
representatives should exercise local powers in Dublin
instead of imperial powers at Westminster.</p>

<p>On the basis of the above arrangement the Bill of Mr.
Gladstone was founded. Absolute local autonomy was
conferred on Ireland; the assent of the Irish members to
quit the Imperial Parliament was accepted; and the Bill
provided that after a certain day the representative Irish
peers should cease to sit in the House of Lords, and the
Irish members vacate their places in the House of Commons.
Provisions were then made for the absorption in
the Irish Legislative Body of both the Irish representative
peers and Irish members.</p>

<p>The legislative supremacy of the British Parliament was
maintained by an express provision excepting from any
interference on the part of Irish Legislature all imperial
powers, and declaring any enactment void which infringed
that provision; further, an enactment was inserted for the
<!-- Page 205 --><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205" />purpose of securing to the English Legislature in the last
resource the absolute power to make any law for the government
of Ireland, and therefore to repeal, or suspend, the
Irish Constitution.</p>

<p>Technically these reservations of supremacy to the
English Legislature were unnecessary, as it is an axiom of
constitutional law that a sovereign Legislature, such as the
Queen and two Houses of Parliament in England, cannot
bind their successors, and consequently can repeal or alter
any law, however fundamental, and annul any restrictions on
alteration, however strongly expressed. Practically they
were never likely to be called into operation, as it is the
custom of Parliament to adhere, under all but the most
extraordinary and unforeseen circumstances, to any compact
made by Act of Parliament between itself and any subordinate
legislative body. The Irish Legislature was subjected
to the same controlling power which has for centuries been
applied to prevent any excess of jurisdiction in our Colonial
Legislatures, by a direction that an appeal as to the constitutionality
of any laws which they might pass should lie
to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. This
supremacy of the imperial judicial power over the action of
the Colonial Legislatures was a system which the founders
of the American Constitution copied in the establishment of
their supreme Court, and thereby secured for that legislative
system a stability which has defied the assaults of faction
and the strain of civil war.</p>

<p>The Executive Government of Ireland was continued in
her Majesty, and was to be carried on by the Lord Lieutenant
on her behalf, by the aid of such officers and such
Council as her Majesty might from time to time see fit. The
initiative power of recommending taxation was also vested
in the Queen, and delegated to the Lord Lieutenant. These
clauses are co-ordinate and correlative with the clause conferring
complete local powers on the Irish Legislature,
<!-- Page 206 --><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206" />while it preserves all imperial powers to the Imperial Legislature.
The Governor is an imperial officer, and will be
bound to watch over imperial interests with a jealous
scrutiny, and to veto any Bill which may be injurious to
those interests. On the other hand, as respects all local
matters, he will act on and be guided by the advice of the
Irish Executive Council. The system is self-acting. The
Governor, for local purposes, must have a Council which is
in harmony with the Legislative Body. If the Governor
and a Council, supported by the Legislative Body, do not
agree, the Governor must give way, unless he can, by dismissing
his Council, and dissolving the Legislative Body,
obtain both a Council and a Legislative Body which will
support his views. As respects imperial questions, the case
is different; here the last word rests with the mother country,
and in the last resort a determination of the Executive
Council, backed by the Legislative Body, to resist imperial
rights, must be deemed an act of rebellion on the part of the
Irish people, and be dealt with accordingly.</p>

<p>In acceding to the claims of the National Party for
Home Rule in Ireland another question had to be considered:
the demands of the English garrison, as it is called&mdash;or,
in plain words, of the class of Irish landlords&mdash;for
protection. They urged that to grant Home Rule in
Ireland would be to hand them over to their enemies, their
tenants, and to lead to an immediate, or to all events a
proximate, confiscation of their properties. Without admitting
the truth of these apprehensions to the full extent, or
indeed to any great extent, it was undoubtedly felt by the
framers of the Home Rule Bill that a moral obligation
rested on the Imperial Government to remove, if possible,
&quot;the fearful exasperations attending the agrarian relations
in Ireland,&quot; rather than leave a question so fraught with
danger, so involved in difficulty, to be determined by the
Irish Government on its first entry on official existence.<!-- Page 207 --><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207" />
Hence the Land Bill, the scheme of which was to frame a
system under which the tenants, by being made owners of
the soil, should become interested as a class in the maintenance
of social order, while the landlords should be
enabled to rid themselves on fair terms of their estates, in
cases where, from apprehension of impending changes, or for
pecuniary reasons, they were desirous of relieving themselves
from the responsibilities of ownership. Of the land scheme
brought into Parliament in 1886, it need only here be said that
it proposed to lend the Irish Government 3 per cent. stock
at 3-1/8 per cent. interest, the Irish Government undertaking
to purchase, from any Irish landlord desirous of selling, his
estate at (as a general rule) twenty years' purchase on the
net rental. The money thus disbursed by the Irish Government
was repaid to them by an annuity, payable by the
tenant for forty-nine years, of 4 per cent. on a capital sum
equal to twenty times the gross rental; the result being
that, were the Bill passed into law, the tenant would become
immediate owner of the land, subject to the payment of an
annuity considerably less than the previous rent&mdash;that the
Irish Government would make a considerable profit on the
transaction, inasmuch as it would receive from the tenant
interest calculated on the basis of the <i>gross</i> rental, whilst it
would pay to the English Government interest calculated on
the basis of the <i>net</i> rental&mdash;and that the English Government
would sustain no loss if the interest were duly received
by them.</p>

<p>The effect of such a plan appears almost magical: Ireland
is transformed at one stroke from a nation of landlords into
a nation of peasant proprietors&mdash;apparently without loss to
any one, and with gain to everybody concerned, except the
British Government, who neither gain nor lose in the matter.
The practicability, however, of such a scheme depends
altogether on the security against loss afforded to the British
tax-payer, for he is industrious and heavily burdened, and
<!-- Page 208 --><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208" />cannot be expected to assent to any plan which will land
him in any appreciable loss. Here it is that the plan
of Mr. Gladstone's Land Bill differs from all other previous
plans. Act after Act has been passed enabling the tenant
to borrow money from the British Government on the
security of the holding, for the purpose of enabling him to
purchase the fee-simple. In such transactions the British
Government becomes the mortgagee, and can only recover
its money, if default is made in payment, by ejecting the
tenant and becoming the landlord. In proportion, then,
as any existing purchase Act succeeds, in the same proportion
the risk of the British taxpayer increases. He is ever
placed in the most invidious of all lights; instead of posing
as the generous benefactor who holds forth his hand to
rescue the landlord and tenant from an intolerable position,
he stands forward either as the grasping mortgagee or as the
still more hated landlord, who, having deprived the tenant
of his holding, is seeking to introduce another man into
property which really belongs to the ejected tenant. Such
a position may be endurable when the number of purchasing
tenants is small, but at once breaks down if agrarian reform
in Ireland is to be extended so far as to make any appreciable
difference in the relations of landlord and tenant;
still more, if it become general. Now, what is the remedy
of such a state of things? Surely to interpose the Irish
Government between the Irish debtor and his English
creditor, and to provide that the Irish revenues in bulk, not
the individual holdings of each tenant, shall be the security
for the English creditor. This was the scheme embodied
in the Land Act of 1886. The punctual payment of all
money due from the Government of Ireland to the Government
of Great Britain was to have been secured by the
continuance in the hands of the British Government of the
Excise and Customs duties, and by the appointment of an
Imperial Receiver-General, assisted by subordinate officers,
<!-- Page 209 --><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209" />and protected by an Imperial Court. This officer would
have received not only all the imperial taxes, but also the
local taxes; and it would have been his duty to satisfy
the claims of the British Government before he allowed any
sum to pass into the Irish Exchequer. In effect, the British
Government, in relation to the levying of imperial taxes,
would have stood in the same relation to Ireland as
Congress does to the United States in respect to the levying
of federal taxes. The fiscal unity of Great Britain and
Ireland would have been in this way secured, and the
British Government protected against any loss of interest
for the large sums to be expended in carrying into effect in
Ireland any agrarian reform worthy of the name.</p>

<p>The Irish Bills of 1886, as above represented, had at
least three recommendations:</p>

<p>1. They created a state of things in Ireland under which
it was possible to make a complete agrarian reform without
exposing the English Exchequer to any appreciable risk.</p>

<p>2. They enabled the Irish to govern themselves as
respects local matters, while preserving intact the supremacy
of the British Parliament and the integrity of the Empire.</p>

<p>3. They enabled the British Parliament to govern the
British Empire without any obstructive Irish interference.</p>

<p>To the first of these propositions no attempt at an answer
has been made. The Land Bill was never considered on
its merits; indeed, was never practically discussed, but was
at once swept into oblivion by the wave which overwhelmed
the Home Rule Bill.</p>

<p>The contention against the second proposition was
concerned in proving that the supremacy of the British
Parliament was not maintained: the practical answer to this
objection has been given above. Pushed to its utmost, it
could only amount to proof that an amendment ought to
have been introduced in Committee, declaring, in words
better selected than those introduced for that purpose in the<!-- Page 210 --><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210" />
Bill, that nothing in the Act should affect the supremacy of
the British Parliament. In short, the whole discussion here
necessarily resolved itself into a mere verbal squabble as to
the construction of a clause in a Bill not yet in Committee,
and had no bottom or substance.</p>

<p>It was also urged that the concession of self-government
to Ireland was but another mode of handing over the
Loyalist party&mdash;or, as it is sometimes called, the English
garrison&mdash;to the tender mercies of the Parnellites. The
reply to this would seem to be, that as respects property
the Land Bill effectually prevented any interference of the
Irish Parliament with the land; nay, more, enabled any
Irishman desirous of turning his land into money to do
so on the most advantageous terms that ever had been&mdash;and
with a falling market it may be confidently prophesied
ever can be&mdash;offered to the Irish landlord; while as respect
life and liberty, were it possible that they should be endangered,
it was the duty of the imperial officer, the Lord Lieutenant,
to take means for the preservation of peace and
good order; and behind him, to enforce his behests, stand
the strong battalions who, to our sorrow be it spoken, have
so often been called upon to put down disturbance and
anarchy in Ireland.</p>

<p>Competing plans have been put forward, with more or
less detail, for governing Ireland. The suggestion that
Ireland should be governed as a <i>Crown</i> colony need only
be mentioned to be rejected. It means in effect, that
Ireland should sink from the rank of an equal or independent
member of the British Empire to the grade of the
most dependent of her colonies, and should be governed
despotically by English officials, without representation in
the English Parliament or any machinery of local self-government.
Another proposal has been to give four provincial
Governments to Ireland, limiting their powers to
local rating, education, and legislation in respect of matters
<!-- Page 211 --><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211" />which form the subjects of private Bill legislation at present;
in fact, to place them somewhat on the footing of the
provinces of Canada, while reserving to the English Parliament
the powers vested in the Dominion of Canada. Such a
scheme would seem adapted to whet the appetite of the Irish
for nationality, without supplying them with any portion of
the real article. It would supply no basis on which a system
of agrarian reform could be founded, as it would be impossible
to leave the determination of a local question, which is
a unit in its dangers and its difficulties, to four different
Legislatures; above all, the hinge on which the question
turns&mdash;the sufficiency of the security for the British taxpayer&mdash;could
not be afforded by provincial resources.
Indeed, no alternative for the Land Bill of 1886 has been
suggested which does not err in one of the following points:
either it pledges English credit on insufficient security, or
it requires the landowners to accept Irish debentures or
some form of Irish paper money at par; in other words, it
makes English taxes a fund for relieving Irish landlords, or
else it compels the Irish landowner, if he sells at all, to
sell at an inadequate price. Before parting with Canada, it
may be worth while noticing that another, and more feasible,
alternative is to imitate more closely the Canadian Constitution,
and to vest the central or Dominion powers in a
central Legislature in Dublin, parcelling out the provincial
powers, as they have been called, amongst several provincial
Legislatures. This scheme might be made available as
a means of protecting Ulster from the supposed danger
of undue interference from the Central Government, and
for making, possibly, other diversities in the local administration
of various parts of Ireland in order to meet special
local exigencies.</p>

<p>A leading writer among the dissentient Liberals has intimated
that one of two forms of representative colonial
government might be imposed on Ireland&mdash;either the form
<!-- Page 212 --><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212" />in which the executive is conducted by colonial officials, or
the form of the great irresponsible colonies. The first of
these forms is open to the objection, that it perpetuates
those struggles between English executive measures and
Irish opinion which has made Ireland for centuries ungovernable,
and led to the establishment of the union and
destruction of Irish independence in 1800; the second
proposal would destroy the fiscal unity of the empire&mdash;leave
the agrarian feud unextinguished, and aggravate
the objections which have been urged against the Home
Rule Bill of 1886. A question still remains, in relation
to the <i>form</i> of the Home Rule Bill of 1886, which would
not have deserved attention but for the prominence given
to it in some of the discussions upon the subject. The
Bill of 1886 provides &quot;that the Legislature may make laws
for the peace, order, and good government of Ireland,&quot; but
subjects their power to numerous exceptions and restrictions.
The Act establishing the Dominion of Canada
enumerates various matters in respect of which the Legislature
of Canada is to have exclusive power, but prefaces
the enumeration with a clause &quot;that the Dominion Legislature
may make laws for the peace, order, and good government
of Canada in relation to all matters not within the
jurisdiction of the provincial Legislatures, although such
matters may not be specially mentioned.&quot; In effect, therefore,
the difference between the Irish Bill and the Canadian
Act is one of expression and not of substance, and, although
the Bill is more accurate in its form, it would scarcely
be worth while to insist on legislating by exception instead
of by enumeration if, by the substitution of the latter form
for the former, any material opposition would be conciliated.</p>

<p>What, then, are the conclusions intended to be drawn
from the foregoing premises?</p>

<p>1. That coercion is played out, and can no longer be
regarded as a remedy for the evils of Irish misrule.<!-- Page 213 --><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213" /></p>

<p>2. That some alternative must be found, and that the
only alternative within the range of practical politics is some
form of Home Rule.</p>

<p>3. That there is no reason for thinking that the grant of
Home Rule to Ireland&mdash;a member only, and not one of the
most important members, of the British Empire&mdash;will in
any way dismember, or even in the slightest degree risk the
dismemberment of the Empire.</p>

<p>4. That Home Rule presupposes and admits the supremacy
of the British Parliament.</p>

<p>5. That theory is in favour of Home Rule, as the

local independence; while the establishment of Home Rule
is a necessary condition to the effectual removal of agrarian
disturbances in Ireland.</p>

<p>For half a century or more no question of English domestic
politics has excited so much interest outside England as
that question of resettling her relations with Ireland, which
was fought over in the last Parliament, and still confronts
the Parliament that has lately been elected. Apart from its
dramatic interest, apart from its influence on the fortune of
parties, and its effect on the imperial position of Great
Britain, it involves so many large principles of statesmanship,
and raises so many delicate points of constitutional
law, as to deserve the study of philosophical thinkers no
less than of practical politicians in every free country.</p>

<p>The circumstances which led to the introduction of the
Government of Ireland Bill, in April, 1886, are familiar to
Americans as well as Englishmen. Ever since the crowns
and parliaments of Great Britain and Ireland were united,
in A.D. 1800, there has been in Ireland a party which protested
against that union as fraudulently obtained and inexpedient
in itself. For many years this party, led by Daniel
O'Connell, maintained an agitation for Repeal. After his
<!-- Page 215 --><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215" />death a more extreme section, which sought the complete
independence of Ireland, raised the insurrection of 1848,
and subsequently, under the guidance of other hands,
formed the Fenian conspiracy, whose projected insurrection
was nipped in the bud in 1867, though the conspiracy continued
to menace the Government and the tranquillity of
the island. In 1872 the Home Rule party was formed,
demanding, not the Repeal of the Union, but the creation
of an Irish Legislature, and the agitation, conducted in
Parliament in a more systematic and persistent way than
heretofore, took also a legitimate constitutional form. To
this demand English and Scotch opinion was at first almost
unanimously opposed. At the General Election of 1880,
which, however, turned mainly on the foreign policy of
Lord Beaconsfield's Government, not more than three or
four members were returned by constituencies in Great
Britain who professed to consider Home Rule as even an
open question. All through the Parliament, which sat from
1880 till 1885, the Nationalist party, led by Mr. Parnell,
and including at first less than half, ultimately about half,
of the Irish members, was in constant and generally bitter
opposition to the Government of Mr. Gladstone. But
during these five years a steady, although silent and often
unconscious, process of change was passing in the minds of
English and Scotch members, especially Liberal members,
due to their growing sense of the mistakes which Parliament
committed in handling Irish questions, and of the hopelessness
of the efforts which the Executive was making to
pacify the country on the old methods. The adoption of a
Home Rule policy by one of the great English parties was,
therefore, not so sudden a change as it seemed. The process
had been going on for years, though in its earlier stages
it was so gradual and so unwelcome as to be faintly felt and
reluctantly admitted by the minds that were undergoing it.
In the spring of 1886 the question could be no longer
<!-- Page 216 --><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216" />evaded or postponed. It was necessary to choose between
one of two courses; the refusal of the demand for self-government,
coupled with the introduction of a severe
Coercion Bill, or the concession of it by the introduction of
a Home Rule Bill. There were some few who suggested,
as a third course, the granting of a limited measure of local
institutions, such as county boards; but most people felt, as
did Mr. Gladstone's Ministry, that this plan would have had
most of the dangers and few of the advantages of either of
the two others.</p>

<p>How the Government of Ireland Bill was brought into
the House of Commons on April 8th, amid circumstances
of curiosity and excitement unparalleled since 1832; how,
after debates of almost unprecedented length, it was defeated
in June, by a majority of thirty; how the policy it embodied
was brought before the country at the General
Election, and failed to win approval&mdash;all this is too well
known to need recapitulation here. But the causes of the
disaster have not been well understood, for it is only
now&mdash;now, when the smoke of the battle has cleared
away from the field&mdash;that these causes have begun to stand
revealed in their true proportions.</p>

<p>Besides some circumstances attending the production
of the Bill, to which I shall refer presently, and which told
heavily against it, there were three feelings which worked
upon men's minds, disposing them to reject it.</p>

<p>The first of these was dislike and fear of the Irish
Nationalist members. In the previous House of Commons
this party had been uniformly and bitterly hostile to the
Liberal Government. Measures intended for the good of
Ireland, like the Land Act of 1881, had been ungraciously
received, treated as concessions extorted, for which no
thanks were due&mdash;inadequate concessions, which must be
made the starting-point for fresh demands. Obstruction
had been freely practised to defeat not only bills restraining
<!-- Page 217 --><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217" />the liberty of the subject in Ireland, but many other
measures. Some few members of the Irish party had
systematically sought to delay all English and Scotch
legislation, and, in fact, to bring the work of Parliament to
a dead stop. Much violent language had been used, even
where the provocation was slight. The outbreaks of crime
which had repeatedly occurred in Ireland had been, not,
indeed, defended, but so often passed over in silence by
Nationalist speakers, that English opinion was inclined to
hold them practically responsible for disorders which, so it
was thought, they had neither wished nor tried to prevent.
(I am, of course, expressing no opinion as to the justice of
this view, nor as to the excuses to be made for the Parliamentary
tactics of the Irish party, but merely stating how
their conduct struck many Englishmen.) There could be
no doubt as to the hostility which they, still less as to that
which their fellow-countrymen in the United States, had
expressed toward England, for they had openly wished
success to Russia while war seemed impending with her,
and the so-called Mahdi of the Soudan was vociferously
cheered at many a Nationalist meeting. At the Election of
1885 they had done their utmost to defeat Liberal candidates
in every English and Scotch constituency where there
existed a body of Irish voters, and had thrown some twenty
seats or more into the hands of the Tories. Now, to many
Englishmen, the proposal to create an Irish Parliament
seemed nothing more or less than a proposal to hand over
to these Irish members the government of Ireland, with all
the opportunities thence arising to oppress the opposite
party in Ireland and to worry England herself. It was all
very well to urge that the tactics which the Nationalists had
pursued when their object was to extort Home Rule would
be dropped, because superfluous, when Home Rule had
been granted; or to point out that an Irish Parliament
would contain different men from those who had been sent
<!-- Page 218 --><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218" />to Westminster as Mr. Parnell's nominees. Neither of these
arguments could overcome the suspicious antipathy which
many Englishmen felt, nor dissolve the association in their
minds between the Nationalist leaders and the forces of disorder.
The Parnellites (thus they reasoned) are bad men;
what they seek is therefore likely to be bad, and whether
bad in itself or not, they will make a bad use of it. In
such reasonings there was more of sentiment and prejudice
than of reason, but sentiment and prejudice are proverbially
harder than arguments to expel from minds where they have
made a lodgment.</p>

<p>The internal condition of Ireland supplied more substantial
grounds for alarm. As everybody knows, she is
not, either in religion or in blood, or in feelings and ideas,
a homogeneous country. Three-fourths of the people are
Roman Catholics, one-fourth Protestants, and this Protestant
fourth subdivided into bodies not fond of one another, who
have little community of sentiment. Besides the Scottish
colony in Ulster, many English families have settled here
and there through the country. They have been regarded
as intruders by the aboriginal Celtic population, and many
of them, although hundreds of years may have passed since
they came, still look on themselves as rather English than
Irish. The last fifty years, whose wonderful changes have
in most parts of the world tended to unite and weld into
one compact body the inhabitants of each part of the earth's
surface, connecting them by the ties of commerce, and of a
far easier and swifter intercourse than was formerly possible,
have in Ireland worked in the opposite direction. It has
become more and more the habit of the richer class in
Ireland to go to England for its enjoyment, and to feel
itself socially rather English than Irish. Thus the chasm
between the immigrants and the aborigines has grown
deeper. The upper class has not that Irish patriotism
which it showed in the days of the National Irish<!-- Page 219 --><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219" />
Parliament (1782-1800), and while there is thus less of a
common national feeling to draw rich and poor together,
the strife of landlords and tenants has continued, irritating
the minds of both parties, and gathering them into two
hostile camps. As everybody knows, the Nationalist agitation
has been intimately associated with the Land agitation&mdash;has,
in fact, found a strong motive-force in the desire of the
tenants to have their rents reduced, and themselves secured
against eviction. Now, many people in England assumed
that an Irish Parliament would be under the control of the
tenants and the humbler class generally, and would therefore
be hostile to the landlords. They went farther, and made
the much bolder assumption that as such a Parliament
would be chosen by electors, most of whom were Roman
Catholics, it would be under the control of the Catholic
priesthood, and hostile to Protestants. Thus they supposed
that the grant of self-government to Ireland would mean the
abandonment of the upper and wealthier class, the landlords
and the Protestants, to the tender mercies of their enemies.
Such abandonment, it was proclaimed on a thousand platforms,
would be disgraceful in itself, dishonouring to England,
a betrayal of the very men who had stood by her in
the past, and were prepared to stand by her in the future,
if only she would stand by them. It was, of course, replied
by the defenders of the Home Rule Bill, that what the so-called
English party in Ireland really stood by was their
own ascendency over the Irish masses&mdash;an oppressive
ascendency, which had caused most of the disorders of
the country. As to religion, there were many Protestants
besides Mr. Parnell himself among the Nationalist leaders.
There was no ill-feeling (except in Ulster) between Protestants
and Roman Catholics in Ireland. There was no
reason to expect that either the Catholic hierarchy or the
priesthood generally would be supreme in an Irish Parliament,
and much reason to expect the contrary. As regards<!-- Page 220 --><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220" />
Ulster, where, no doubt, there were special difficulties, due
to the bitter antagonism of the Orangemen (not of the Protestants
generally) and Catholics, Mr. Gladstone had undertaken
to consider any special provisions which could be
suggested as proper to meet those difficulties. These
replies, however, made little impression. They were pronounced,
and pronounced all the more confidently the
more ignorant of Ireland the speaker was, to be too
hypothetical. To many Englishmen the case seemed to
be one of two hostile factions contending in Ireland for
the last sixty years, and that the gift of self-government
might enable one of them to tyrannize over the other.
True, that party was the majority, and, according to the
principles of democratic government, therefore entitled to
prevail. But it is one thing to admit a principle and another
to consent to its application. The minority had the sympathy
of the upper classes in England, because the minority
contained the landlords. It had the sympathy of a part of
the middle class, because it contained the Protestants. And
of those Englishmen who were impartial as between the Irish
factions, there were some who held that England must in
any case remain responsible for the internal peace and the
just government of Ireland, and could not grant powers
whose possession might tempt the one party to injustice,
and the other to resist injustice by violence.</p>

<p>There was another anticipation, another forecast of evils
to follow, which told most of all upon English opinion.
This was the notion that Home Rule was only a stage in
the road to the complete separation of the two islands. The
argument was conceived as follows: &quot;The motive passions
of the Irish agitation have all along been hatred toward
England and a desire to make Ireland a nation, holding her
independent place among the nations of the world. This
design was proclaimed by the Young Irelanders of 1848 and
by the Fenian rebels of 1866; it has been avowed, in inter<!-- Page 221 --><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221" />vals
of candour, by the present Nationalists themselves.
The grant of an Irish Parliament will stimulate rather than
appease this thirst for separate national existence. The
nearer complete independence seems, the more will it be
desired. Hatred to England will still be an active force,
because the amount of control which England retains will
irritate Irish pride, as well as limit Irish action; while all
the misfortunes which may befall the new Irish Government
will be blamed, not on its own imprudence, but on the
English connection. And as the motives for seeking
separation will remain, so the prospect of obtaining it
will seem better. Agitation will have a better vantage-ground
in an Irish Parliament than it formerly had among
the Irish members of a British Legislature; and if actual
resistance to the Queen's authority should be attempted, it
will be attempted under conditions more favourable than
the present, because the rebels will have in their hands the
machinery of Irish Government, large financial resources,
and a <i>prima facie</i> title to represent the will of the Irish
people. As against a rebellious party in Ireland, England
has now two advantages&mdash;an advantage of theory, an advantage
of fact. The advantage of theory is that she does not
admit Ireland to be a distinct nation, but maintains that in
the United Kingdom there is but one nation, whereof some
inhabit Great Britain and some Ireland. The advantage of
fact is that, through her control of the constabulary, the
magistrates, the courts of justice, and, in fine, the whole
administrative system of Ireland, she can easily quell insurrectionary
movements. By creating an Irish Parliament
and Government she would strip herself of both these
advantages.&quot;</p>

<p>I need hardly say that I do not admit the fairness of this
statement of the case, because some of the premises are
untrue, and because it misrepresents the nature of the Irish
Government which Mr. Gladstone's Bill would have created.<!-- Page 222 --><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222" />
But I am trying to state the case as it was sedulously and
skilfully presented to Englishmen. And it told all the
more upon English waverers, because the considerations
above mentioned seemed, if well founded, to destroy
and cut away the chief ground on which Home Rule had
been advocated, viz. that it would relieve England from
the constant pressure of Irish discontent and agitation, and
bring about a time of tranquillity, permitting good feeling to
grow up between the peoples. If Home Rule was, after all,
to be nothing more than a half-way house to independence,
an Irish Parliament only a means of extorting a more complete
emancipation from imperial control, was it not much
better to keep things as they were, and go on enduring evils,
the worst of which were known already? Hence the advocates
of the Bill denied not the weight of the argument, but
its applicability. Separation, they urged, is impossible, for
it is contrary to the nature of things, which indicates that
the two islands must go together. It is not desired by the
Irish people, for it would injure them far more than it could
possibly injure England, since Ireland finds in England the
only market for her produce, the only source whence capital
flows to her. A small revolutionary party has, no doubt,
conspired to obtain it. But the only sympathy they received
was due to the fact that the legitimate demand of Ireland
for a recognition of her national feeling and for the management
of her own local affairs was contemptuously ignored by
England. The concession of that demand will banish the
notion even from those minds which now entertain it,
whereas its continued refusal may perpetuate that alienation
of feeling which is at the bottom of all the mischief, the one
force that makes for separation.</p>

<p>It is no part of my present purpose to examine these
arguments and counter arguments, but only to show what
were the grounds on which a majority of the English voters
refused to pronounce in favour of the Home Rule Bill. The
<!-- Page 223 --><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223" />reader will have observed that the issues raised were not only
numerous, but full of difficulty. They were issues of fact,
involving a knowledge both of the past history of Ireland and
of her present state. They were also issues of inference, for
even supposing the broad facts to be ascertained, these facts
were susceptible of different interpretations, and men might,
and did, honestly draw opposite conclusions from them. A
more obscure and complicated problem, or rather group of
problems, has seldom been presented to a nation for its
decision. But the nation did not possess the requisite
knowledge. Closely connected as Ireland seems to be with
England, long as the Irish question has been a main trouble
in English politics, the English and Scottish people know
amazingly little about Ireland. Even in the upper class,
you meet with comparatively few persons who have set foot
on Irish soil, and, of course, far fewer who have ever
examined the condition of the island and the sources of her
discontent. Irish history, which is, no doubt, dismal reading,
is a blank page to the English. In January, 1886, one
found scarce any politicians who had ever heard of the Irish
Parliament of 1782. And in that year, 1886, an Englishman
anxious to discover the real state of the country did
not know where to go for information. What appeared
in the English newspapers, or, rather, in the one English
newspaper which keeps a standing &quot;own correspondent&quot;
in Dublin, was (as it still is) a grossly and almost
avowedly partisan report, in which opinions are skilfully
mixed with so-called facts, selected, consciously or unconsciously,
to support the writer's view. The Nationalist
press is, of course, not less strongly partisan on its own side,
so that not merely an average Englishman, but even the
editor of an English newspaper, who desires to ascertain the
true state of matters and place it before his English readers,
has had, until within the last few months, when events
in Ireland began to be fully reported in Great Britain,
<!-- Page 224 --><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224" />no better means at his disposal for understanding Ireland
than for understanding Bulgaria. I do not dwell upon this
ignorance as an argument for Home Rule, though, of course,
it is often so used. I merely wish to explain the bewilderment
in which Englishmen found themselves when required
to settle by their votes a question of immense difficulty.
Many, on both sides, simply followed their party banners.
Tories voted for Lord Salisbury; thorough-going admirers
of Mr. Gladstone voted for Mr. Gladstone. But there was
on the Liberal side a great mass who were utterly perplexed
by the position. Contradictory statements of fact, as well
as contradictory arguments, were flung at their heads in distracting
profusion. They felt themselves unable to determine
what was true and who was right. But one thing seemed
clear to them. The policy of Home Rule was a new policy.
They had been accustomed to censure and oppose it. Only
nine months before, the Irish Nationalists had emphasized
their hostility to the Liberal party by doing their utmost to
defeat Liberal candidates in English constituencies. Hence,
when it was proclaimed that Home Rule was the true
remedy which the Liberal party must accept, they were
startled and discomposed.</p>

<p>Now, the English are not a nimble-minded people.
They cannot, to use a familiar metaphor, turn round in
their own length. Their momentum is such as to carry
them on for some distance in the direction wherein they
have been moving, even after the order to stop has been
given. They need time to appreciate, digest, and comprehend
a new proposition. Timid they are not, nor, perhaps,
exceptionally cautious, but they do not like to be hurried, and
insist on looking at a proposition for a good while before they
come to a decision regarding it. It is one of the qualities
which make them a great people. As has been observed,
this proposition was novel, was most serious, and raised
questions which they felt that their knowledge was insuf<!-- Page 225 --><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225" />ficient
to determine. Accordingly, a certain section of
the Liberal party refused to accept it. A great number,
probably the majority, of these doubtful men abstained
from voting. Others voted against the Home Rule Liberal
candidates, not necessarily because they condemned the
policy, but because, as they were not satisfied that it
was right, they deemed delay a less evil than the committal
of the nation to a new departure, which might prove
irrevocable.</p>

<p>It must not, however, be supposed that it was only hesitation
which drove many Liberals into the host arrayed against
the Irish Government Bill. I have already said that among
the leaders there were some, and those men of great influence,
who condemned its principles. This was true also of
a considerable, though a relatively smaller, section of the
rank and file. And it was only what might have been
expected. The proposal to undo much of the work done
in 1800, to alter fundamentally the system which had for
eighty-six years regulated the relations of the two islands, by
setting up a Parliament in Ireland, was a proposal which not
only had not formed a part of the accepted creed of the
Liberal party, but fell outside party lines altogether. It
might, no doubt, be argued, as was actually done, and as
those who understand the history of the Liberal party have
more and more come to see, that Liberal principles recommended
it, since they involve faith in the people, and faith
in the curative tendency of local self-government. But this
was by no means axiomatic. Taking the whole complicated
facts of the case, and taking Liberalism as it had been practically
understood in England, a man might in July, 1886,
deem himself a good Liberal and yet think that the true
interests of both peoples would be best served by maintaining
the existing Parliamentary system. Similarly, there was
nothing in Toryism or Tory principles to prevent a fair-minded
and patriotic Tory from approving the Home Rule scheme.<!-- Page 226 --><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226" />
It was a return to the older institutions of the monarchy, and
not inconsistent with any of the doctrines which the Tory
party had been accustomed to uphold. The question, in
short, was one of those which cut across ordinary party lines,
creating new divisions among politicians; and there might
have been and ought to have been Liberal Home Rulers
and Tory Home Rulers, Liberal opponents of Home Rule
and Tory opponents of Home Rule.</p>

<p>But here comes in a feature, a natural but none the less
a regrettable feature, of the English party system. As the
object of the party in opposition is to turn out the party in
power and seat itself in their place, every Opposition regards
with the strongest prejudice the measures proposed by a
ruling Ministry. Cases sometimes occur where these
measures are so obviously necessary, or so evidently approved
by the nation, that the Opposition accepts them.
But in general it scans them with a hostile eye. Human
nature is human nature; and when the defeat of Government
can be secured by defeating a Government Bill, the
temptation to the Opposition to secure it is irresistible.
Now, the Tory party is far more cohesive than the Liberal
party, far more obedient to its leaders, far less disposed to
break into sections, each of which thinks and acts for itself.
Accordingly, that division of opinion in the Tory party which
might have been expected, and which would have occurred
if those who composed the Tory party had been merely so
many reflecting men, and not members of a closely compacted
political organization, did not occur. Liberals were
divided, as such a question would naturally divide them.
Tories were not divided; they threw their whole strength
against the Bill. I am far from suggesting that they did so
against their consciences. Whatever may be said as to two
or three of the leaders, whose previous language and conduct
seemed to indicate that they would themselves, had the
election of 1885 gone differently, have been inclined to a<!-- Page 227 --><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227" />
Home Rule policy, many of the Tory chiefs, as well as the
great mass of the party, honestly disapproved Mr. Gladstone's
measure. But their party motives and party affiliations gave
it no chance of an impartial verdict at their hands. They
went into the jury-box with an invincible prepossession
against the scheme of their opponents. When all these
difficulties are duly considered, and especially when regard
is had to those which I have last enumerated, the suddenness
with which the new policy was launched, and the fact
that as coming from one party it was sure beforehand of the
hostility of the other, no surprise can be felt at its fate.
Those who, in England, now look back over the spring and
summer of 1886 are rather surprised that it should come so
near succeeding. To have been rejected by a majority of
only thirty in Parliament, and of little over ten per cent.
of the total number of electors who voted at the general
election, is a defeat far less severe than any one who knew
England would have predicted.</p>

<p>That the decision of the country is regarded by nobody
as a final decision goes without saying. It was not regarded
as final, even in the first weeks after it was given. This was
not because the majority was comparatively small, for a
smaller majority the other way would have been conclusive.
It is because the country had not time enough for full consideration
and deliberate judgment. The Bill was brought
in on April 14th, the elections began on July 1st; no one
can say what might have been the result of a long discussion,
during which the first feelings of alarm (for alarm there was)
might have worn off. And the decision is without finality,
also, because the decision of the country was merely against
the particular plan proposed by Mr. Gladstone, and not in
favour of any alternative plan for dealing with Ireland,
most certainly not for the coercive method which has since
been adopted. One particular solution of the Irish problem
was refused. The problem still stands confronting us, and
<!-- Page 228 --><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228" />when other modes of solving it have been in turn rejected,
the country may come back to this mode.</p>

<p>We may now turn from the past to the future. Yet the
account which has been given of the feelings and ideas
arrayed against the Bill does not wholly belong to the past.
They are the feelings to which the opponents of any plan of
self-government for Ireland still appeal, and which will have
to be removed or softened down before it can be accepted
by the English. In particular, the probability of separation,
and the supposed dangers to the Protestants and the landlords
from an Irish Parliament, will continue to form the
themes of controversy so long as the question remains
unsettled.</p>

<p>What are the prospects of its settlement? What is the
position which it now occupies? How has it affected the
current politics of England?</p>

<p>It broke up the Liberal party in Parliament. The vast
numerical majority of that party in the country supported,
and still supports, Mr. Gladstone and the policy of Irish self-government.
But the dissentient minority includes many
men of influence, and constitutes in the House of Commons
a body of about seventy members, who hold the balance
between parties. For the present they are leagued with the
Tory Ministry to resist Home Rule, and their support insures
a parliamentary majority to that Ministry. But it is, of
course, necessary for them to rally to Lord Salisbury, not
only on Irish questions, but on all questions; for, under our
English system, a Ministry defeated on any serious issue is
bound to resign, or dissolve Parliament. Now, to maintain an
alliance for a special purpose, between members of opposite
parties, is a hard matter. Agreement about Ireland does not,
of itself, help men to agree about foreign policy, or bimetallism,
or free trade, or changes in land laws, or ecclesiastical affairs.
When these and other grave questions come up in Parliament,
the Tory Ministry and their Liberal allies must, on
<!-- Page 229 --><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229" />every occasion, negotiate a species of concordat, whereby
the liberty of both is fettered. One party may wish to
resist innovation, the other to yield to it, or even to anticipate
it. Each is obliged to forego something in order
to humour the other; neither has the pleasure or the
credit of taking a bold line on its own responsibility. There
is, no doubt, less difference between the respective tenets of
the great English parties than there was twenty years ago,
when Mr. Disraeli had not yet completed the education of
one party, and economic laws were still revered by the
other. But, besides its tenets, each party has its tendencies,
its sympathies, its moral atmosphere; and these differ so
widely as to make the co-operation of Tories and Liberals
constrained and cumbrous. Moreover, there are the men
to be considered, the leaders on each side, whose jealousies,
rivalries, suspicions, personal incompatibilities, neither old
habits of joint action nor corporate party feeling exist to
soften. On the whole, therefore, it is unlikely that the
league of these two parties, united for one question only,
and that a question which will pass into new phases, can be
durable. Either the league will dissolve, or the smaller
party will be absorbed into the larger. In England, as in
America, third parties rarely last. The attraction of the
larger mass is irresistible, and when the crisis which created
a split or generated a new group has passed, or the opinion
the new group advocates has been either generally discredited
or generally adopted, the small party melts away,
its older members disappearing from public life, its younger
ones finding their career in the ranks of one of the two great
standing armies of politics. If the dissentient, or anti-Home
Rule, Liberal party lives till the next general election,
it cannot live longer, for at that election it will be ground
to powder between the upper and nether millstones of the
regular Liberals and the regular Tories.</p>

<p>The Irish struggle of 1886 has had another momentous
<!-- Page 230 --><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230" />consequence. It has brought the Nationalist or Parnellite
party into friendly relations with the mass of English
Liberals. When the Home Rule party was founded by
Mr. Butt, some fifteen years ago, it had more in common
with the Liberal than with the Tory party. But as it
demanded what both English parties were then resolved to
refuse, it was forced into antagonism to both; and from
1877 onward (Mr. Butt being then dead) the antagonism
became bitter, and, of course, specially bitter as toward the
statesmen in power, because it was they who continued
to refuse what the Nationalists sought. Mr. Parnell has
always stated, with perfect candour, that he and his friends
must fight for their own hand unhampered by English
alliances, and getting the most they could for Ireland from
the weakness of either English party. This position they
still retain. If the Tory party will give them Home Rule,
they will help the Tory party. However, as the Tory party
has gained office by opposing Home Rule, this contingency
may seem not to lie within the immediate future. On the
other hand, the Gladstonian Liberals have lost office for
their advocacy of Home Rule, and now stand pledged to
maintain the policy they have proclaimed. The Nationalists
have, therefore, for the first time since the days immediately
following the Union of A.D. 1800 (a measure which the Whigs
of those days resisted), a great English party admitting the
justice of their claim, and inviting them to agitate for it by
purely constitutional methods. For such an alliance the
English Liberals are hotly reproached, both by the Tories
and by the dissentients who follow Lord Harrington and Mr.
Chamberlain. They are accused of disloyalty to England.
The past acts and words of the Nationalists are thrown in
their teeth, and they are told that in supporting the Irish
claim they condone such acts, they adopt such words.
They reply by denying the adoption, and by pointing out
that the Tories themselves were from 1881 till 1886 in
<!-- Page 231 --><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231" />a practical, and often very close, though unavowed, Parliamentary
alliance with the Nationalists in the House of
Commons. The student of history will, however, conceive
that the Liberals have a stronger and higher defence than
any <i>tu quoque</i>. Issues that involve the welfare of peoples
are far too serious for us to apply to them the same sentiments
of personal taste and predilection which we follow
in inviting a dinner party, or selecting companions for a
vacation tour. If a man has abused your brother, or got
drunk in the street, you do not ask him to go with you to the
Yellowstone Park. But his social offences do not prevent
you from siding with him in a political convention. So, in
politics itself, one must distinguish between characters and
opinions. If a man has shown himself unscrupulous or
headstrong, you may properly refuse to vote him into
office, or to sit in the same Cabinet with him, because you
think these faults of his dangerous to the country. But
if the cause he pleads be a just one, you have no more
right to be prejudiced against it by his conduct than a
judge has to be swayed by dislike to the counsel who
argues a case. There were moderate men in America,
who, in the days of the anti-slavery movement, cited against
it the intemperate language of many abolitionists. There
were aristocrats in England, who, during the struggle for
the freedom and unity of Italy, sought to discredit the
patriotic party by accusing them of tyrannicide. But the
sound sense of both nations refused to be led away by such
arguments, because it held those two causes to be in their
essence righteous. In all revolutionary movements there
are elements of excess and violence, which sober men may
regret, but which must not disturb our judgment as to the
substantial merits of an issue. The revolutionist of one
generation is, like Garibaldi or Mazzini, the hero of the
next; and the verdict of posterity applauds those who, even
in his own day, were able to discern the justice of the
<!-- Page 232 --><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232" />cause under the errors or faults of its champion. Doubly
is it the duty of a great and far-sighted statesman not to
be repelled by such errors, when he can, by espousing a
revolutionary movement, purify it of its revolutionary
character, and turn it into a legitimate constitutional struggle.
This is what Mr. Gladstone has done. If his policy be in
itself dangerous and disloyal to the true interests of the
people of our islands, let it be condemned. But if it be
the policy which has the best promise for the peace, the
prosperity, and the mutual good will of those peoples, he
and those who follow him would be culpable indeed were
they to be deterred by the condemnation which they have so
often expressed, and which they still express, for some of
the past acts of a particular party, from declaring that the
aims of that party were substantially right aims, and from
now pressing upon the country what their conscience
approves.</p>

<p>However, as the Home Rule Liberals and Nationalists,
taken together, are in a minority (although a minority which
obtains recruits at many bye-elections) in the present Parliament,
it is not from them that fresh proposals are
expected. They will, of course, continue to speak, write,
and agitate on behalf of the views they hold. But practical
attempt to deal with Irish troubles must for the present
come from the Tory Ministry; for in the English system of
government those who command a Parliamentary majority
are responsible for legislation as well as administration, and
are censured not merely if their legislation is bad, but if it
is not forthcoming when events call for it.</p>

<p>Why, it may be asked, should Lord Salisbury's Government
burn its fingers over Ireland, as so many governments
have burnt their fingers before? Why not let Ireland
alone, giving to foreign affairs and to English and Scottish
reforms all the attention which these too much neglected
matters need?</p>

<p><!-- Page 233 --><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233" />Well would it be for England, as well as for English
Ministries, if Ireland could be simply let alone, her maladies
left to be healed by the soft, slow hand of nature. But
Irish troubles call aloud to be dealt with, and that promptly.
They stand in the way of all other reforms, indeed of all
other business. Letting alone has been tried, and it has
succeeded no better, even in times less urgent than the
present, than the usual policy of coercion followed by
concession, or concession followed by coercion.</p>

<p>There are three aspects of the Irish question, three
channels by which the troubles of the &quot;distressful island&quot;
stream down upon us, forcing whoever now rules or may
come to rule in England to attempt some plan for dealing
with them. I will take them in succession.</p>

<p>The first is the Parliamentary difficulty. In the British
House of Commons, with its six hundred and seventy
members, there are nearly ninety Irish Nationalists. They
are a well-disciplined body, voting as one man, though
capable of speaking enough for a thousand. They have no
interest in English or Scotch or colonial or Indian affairs,
but only in Irish, and look upon the vote which they have
the right of giving upon the former solely as a means of
furthering their own Irish aims. They are, therefore, in the
British Parliament not merely a foreign body, indifferent to
the great British and imperial issues confided to it, but
a hostile body, opposed to its present constitution, seeking
to discredit it in its authority over Ireland, and to make
more and more palpable and incurable the incompetence
for Irish business whereof they accuse it. Several modes
of doing this are open to them. They may, as some of
the more actively bitter among them did in the Parliaments
of 1874 and 1880, obstruct business by long and frequent
speeches, dilatory motions, and all those devices which in
America are called filibustering. The House of Commons
may, no doubt, try to check these tactics by more stringent
<!-- Page 234 --><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234" />rules of procedure, but the attempts already made in this
direction have had but slight success, and every restriction
of debate, since it trenches on the freedom of English and
Scotch no less than of Irish members, injures Parliament as
a whole. They may disgust the British people with the
House of Commons by keeping it (as they have done in
former years) so constantly occupied with Irish business as
to leave it little time for English and Scotch measures.
They may throw the weight of their collective vote into the
scale of one or other British party, according to the amount
of concession it will make to them, or, by always voting
against the Ministry of the day, they may cause frequent
and sudden changes of Government. This plan also they
have followed in time past; for the moment it is not so
applicable, because the Tories and dissentient Liberals,
taken together, possess a majority in the House of
Commons. But at any moment the alliance of those two
sections may vanish, or another General Election may leave
Tories and Liberals so nearly balanced that the Irish vote
could turn the scale. Whoever reflects on the nature of
Parliamentary Government will perceive that it is based on
the assumption that the members of the ruling assembly,
however much they may differ on other subjects, agree in
desiring the strength, dignity, and welfare of the assembly
itself, and in caring for the main national interests which it
controls. He will therefore be prepared to expect countless
and multiform difficulties in working such a Government,
where a large section of the assembly seeks not to use,
but to make useless, its forms and rules&mdash;not to preserve,
but to lower and destroy, its honour, its credit, its efficiency.
In vain are Irish members blamed for these tactics, for they
answer that the interests of their own country require them
to seek first her welfare, which can in their view be secured
only by removing her from the direct control of what they
deem a foreign assembly. Now that the demand for Irish
<!-- Page 235 --><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235" />self-government has obtained the sympathy of the bulk of
English Liberals, they are unlikely forthwith to resume the
systematic obstruction of past years. But they will be able,
without alienating their English friends, to render the
conduct of Parliamentary business so difficult that every
English Ministry will be forced either to crush them, if it
can, or to appease them by a series of concessions.</p>

<p>The second difficulty is that of maintaining social order
in Ireland. What that difficulty is, and whence it arises,
every one knows. It is chronic, but every second or third
winter, when there has been a wet season, or the price of
live stock declines, it becomes specially acute. The tenants
refuse to pay rents which they declare to be impossible.
The landlords, or the harsher among them, try to enforce
rents by evictions; evictions are resisted by outrages and
boycotting. Popular sentiment supports those who commit
outrages, because it considers the tenantry to be engaged in
a species of war, a righteous war, against the landlord.
Evidence can seldom be obtained, and juries acquit in the
teeth of evidence. Thus the enforcement of the law strains
all the resources of authority, while a habit of lawlessness
and discontent is transmitted from generation to generation.
Of the remedies proposed for this chronic evil the most
obvious is the strengthening of the criminal law. We have
been trying this for more than one hundred years, since
Whiteboyism appeared, and trying it in vain. Since the
Union, Coercion Acts, of more or less severity, have been
almost always in force in Ireland, passed for two or three
years, then dropped for a year or two, then renewed in a
form slightly varying, but always with the same result of
driving the disease in for a time, but not curing it. Mr.
Gladstone proposed to buy out the landlords and then
leave an Irish Parliament to restore social order, with that
authority which it would derive from having the will of
the people behind it; because he held that when the
<!-- Page 236 --><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236" />people felt the law to be of their own making, and not
imposed from without, their sentiment would be enlisted on
its side, and the necessity for a firm Government recognized.
This plan, has, however, been rejected, so the choice was left
of a fresh Coercion Act, or of some scheme, necessarily a
costly scheme, for getting rid of the source of trouble by
transferring the land of Ireland to the peasantry. The
present Government, while guided by Sir M. Hicks-Beach,
who had some knowledge of Ireland, did its best to persuade
the landlords to accept reduced rents, while the
Nationalist leaders, on their side, sought to restrain the
people from outrages. But the armistice did not last. The
Ministry yielded to the foolish counsels of its more violent
supporters, and entrusted Irish affairs to the hands of a
Chief Secretary without previous knowledge of the island.
An unusually severe Coercion Act has been brought in and
passed by the aid of the dissentient Liberals. And we
now see this Act administered with a mixture of virulence
and incompetence to which even the dreary annals of Irish
misgovernment present few parallels. The feeling of the
English people is rising against the policy carried out in
their name. So far from being solved, the problem of
social order becomes every day more acute.</p>

<p>There remains the question of a reform of local government.
For many years past, every English Ministry has
undertaken to frame a measure creating a new system of
popular rural self-government in England. It is the first
large task of domestic legislation which we ask from Parliament.
When such a scheme is proposed, can Ireland be
left out of it? Should she be left out, the argument that
she is being treated unequally and unfairly, as compared
with England, would gain immense force; because the
present local government of Ireland is admittedly less
popular, less efficient, altogether less defensible, than even
that of England which we are going to reform. If, there<!-- Page 237 --><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237" />fore,
the theory that the Imperial Parliament is both anxious
and able to do its duty by Ireland is to be maintained,
Ireland, too, must have her scheme of local government.
And a scheme of local government is a large project, the
discussion of which must pass into a discussion of the
government of the island as a whole.</p>

<p>Since, then, we may conclude that whatever Ministry is
in power will be bound to take up the state of Ireland&mdash;since
Parliament and the nation will be occupied with the
subject during the coming sessions fully as much as they
have been during those that have recently passed&mdash;the next
inquiry is, What will the tendency of opinion and legislation
be? Will the reasons and forces described above bring us
to Home Rule? and if so, when, how, and why?</p>

<p>There are grounds for answering these questions in the
negative. A majority of the House of Commons, including
the present Ministry and such influential Liberals as Mr.
Bright, Lord Hartington, Mr. Chamberlain, stand pledged
to resist it, and seem&mdash;such is the passion which controversy
engenders&mdash;more disposed to resist it than they
were in 1885. But this ground is less strong than it may
appear. We have had too many changes of opinion&mdash;ay,
and of action too&mdash;upon Irish affairs not to be prepared for
further changes. A Ministry in power learns much which
an Opposition fails to learn. Home Rule is an elastic expression,
and some of those who were loudest in denouncing
Mr. Gladstone's Bill will find it easy to explain, should they
bring in a Bill of their own for giving self-government to
Ireland, that their measure is a different thing, and free
from the objections brought against his. Nor, if such a
conversion should come, need it be deemed a dishonest one,
for events are potent teachers, and governments now seek
rather to follow than to form opinion. Although a decent
interval must be allowed, no one will be astonished if the
Tory leaders should move ere long in the direction indicated.<!-- Page 238 --><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238" />
Toryism itself, as has been remarked already, contains
nothing opposed to the idea.</p>

<p>Far greater obstacles exist in the aversion which (as
already observed) so many Englishmen of both parties have
entertained for any scheme which should seem to leave the
Protestant minority at the mercy of the peasant and Roman
Catholic majority, and to carry us some way toward the
ultimate separation of the islands. These alarms are
genuine and deep-seated. One who (like the present writer)
thinks them, if not baseless, yet immensely overstrained, is,
of course, convinced that they may be allayed. But time
must first pass, and the plan that is to allay them may
have to be framed on somewhat different lines from those
of Mr. Gladstone's measure. It is even possible that a
conflict more sharp and painful than any of recent years
may intervene before a settlement is reached.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, great as are the obstacles in the way, bitter
as are the reproaches with which Mr. Gladstone is pursued
by the richer classes in England, there is good reason to
believe that the current is setting toward his policy. In
proceeding to state the grounds for this view, I must frankly
own that I am no longer (as in most of the preceding pages)
merely setting forth facts on which impartial men in England
would agree. The forecast which I seek to give may be
tinged by my own belief that the grant of self-government
is the best, if not the only method, now open to us of
establishing peace between the islands, relieving the English
Parliament of work it is ill fitted to discharge, allowing
Ireland opportunities to learn those lessons in politics which
her people so much need. The future, even the near future,
is more than usually dim. Yet, if we examine those three
branches of the Irish question which have been enumerated
above, we shall see how naturally, in each of them, the concession
of self-government seems to open, I will not say the
most direct, but the least dangerous way, out of our troubles.</p>

<p><!-- Page 239 --><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239" />The Parliamentary difficulty arises from the fact that the
representatives of Ireland have the feelings of foreigners
sitting in a foreign assembly, whose honour and usefulness
they do not desire. While these are their feelings they
cannot work properly in it, and it cannot work properly
with them. The inconvenience may be endured, but the
English will grow tired of it, and be disposed to rid themselves
of it, if they see their way to do so without greater
mischief. There are but two ways out of the difficulty.
One is to get rid of the Irish members altogether; the
other is to make them, by the concession of their just
demands, contented and loyal members of a truly united
Parliament. The experience of the Parliament of 1880,
which was mainly occupied with Irish business, and began,
being a strongly Liberal Parliament, with a bias toward the
Irish popular party, showed how difficult it is for a House
of Commons which is ignorant of Ireland to legislate
wisely for it. In the House of Lords there is not a
single Nationalist; indeed, up till 1886, that exalted
chamber contained only one peer, Lord Dalhousie (formerly
member for Liverpool), who had ever said a word in favour
of Home Rule. The more that England becomes sensible,
as she must become sensible, of the deficiencies of the
present machinery for appreciating the needs and giving
effect to the wishes of Irishmen, the more disposed will she
be to grant them some machinery of their own.</p>

<p>As regards social order, I have shown that the choice
which lies before the opponents of Home Rule is either to
continue the policy of coercing the peasantry by severe
special legislation, or to remove the source of friction by
buying out the landlords for the benefit of the tenants.
The present Ministry have chosen the former alternative,
but they dangle before the eyes of their supporters some
prospect that they may ultimately revert to the latter. Now,
the only way that has yet been pointed out of buying out
<!-- Page 240 --><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240" />the landlords, without imposing tremendous liabilities of
loss upon the British Treasury, is the creation of a strong
Home Rule Government in Dublin. Supposing, however,
that some other plan could be discovered, which would
avoid the fatal objections to which an extension of the plan
of the (Salisbury) Land Purchase Act of 1885 is open, such
a plan would remove one of the chief objections to an Irish
Parliament, by leaving no estates for such a Parliament to
confiscate. As for coercion every day, I might say, every
bye-election shows us how it becomes more and more odious
to the British democracy. They dislike severity; they dislike
the inequality involved in passing harsher laws for Ireland
than those that apply to England and Scotland. They find
themselves forced to sympathize with acts of violence in
Ireland which they would condemn in Great Britain,
because these acts seem the only way of resisting harsh
and unjust laws. When the recoil comes, it will be more
violent than in former days. The wish to discover some
other course will be very strong, and the obvious other
course will be to leave it to an Irish authority to enforce
social order in its own way&mdash;probably a more rough-and-ready
way than that of British officials. The notion which
has possessed most Englishmen, that Irish self-government
would be another name for anarchy, is curiously erroneous.
Conflicts there may be, but a vigorous rule will emerge.</p>

<p>Lastly, as to local government. If a popular system is
established in Ireland&mdash;one similar to that which it is proposed
to establish in England&mdash;the control of its assemblies
and officials will, over four-fifths of the island, fall into
Nationalist hands. Their power will be enormously increased,
for they will then command the machinery of
administration, and the power of taxing. What with taxing
landlords, aiding recalcitrant tenants, stopping the wheels
of any central authority which may displease or oppose
them, they will be in so strong a position that the creation
<!-- Page 241 --><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241" />of an Irish Parliament may appear to be a comparatively
small further step, may even appear (as the wisest Nationalists
now think it would prove) in the light of a check upon the
abuse of local powers. These eventualities will unquestionably,
when English opinion has realized them, make such a
Parliament as the present pause before it commits rural local
government to the Irish democracy. But it could not refuse
to do something; and if it tried to restrain popular representative
bodies by the veto of a bureaucracy in Dublin,
there would arise occasions for quarrel and irritation more
serious than now exist.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70" /><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Those who once begin to repair an
old and tottering building are led on, little by little, into
changes they did not at starting contemplate. So it will be
if once the task is undertaken of reforming the confessedly
bad and indefensible system of Irish administration. We
may stop at some half-way house on the way, but Home Rule
stands at the end of the road.</p>

<p>Supposing, then, that the Nationalist party, retaining its
present strength and unity, perseveres in its present
demands, there is every prospect that these demands will
be granted. But will it persevere? There are among the
English Dissentients those who prophesy that it will break
up, as such parties have broken up before&mdash;will lose hope and
wither away. Or the support of the Irish peasantry may be
withdrawn&mdash;a result which some English politicians expect
from a final settlement of the land question in the interest
of the tenants. Any of these contingencies is possible, but at
present most improbable. The moment when long-cherished
aims begin to seem attainable is not that at which men are
disposed to abandon them.</p>

<p>There are, however, other reasons which suggest the
likelihood of a change in English sentiment on the whole
<!-- Page 242 --><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242" />matter. The surprise with which the Bill of last April was
received has worn off. The alarm is wearing off too.
Those who set their teeth at what seemed to them a surrender
to the Parnellites and their Irish-American allies,
having relieved their temper by an emphatic No, have begun
to ponder things more calmly. The English people are
listening to the arguments from Irish history that are now
addressed to them. They will be moved by the solid
grounds of policy which that history suggests; will understand
that what they have deemed insensate hatred is the
natural result of long misgovernment, and will disappear
with time and the removal of its causes. Many of the best
minds of both nations will be at work to discover some
method of reconciling Irish self-government with imperial
supremacy and union free from the objections brought
against the Bills of 1886. It is reasonable to expect that
they may greatly improve upon these measures, which
were prepared under pressure from a clamorous Opposition.
What Mr. Disraeli once called the historical
conscience of the country will appreciate those great
underlying principles to which Mr. Gladstone's policy
appeals. It has been accused of being a policy of despair;
and may have commended itself to some who supported it
as being simply a means of ridding England of responsibility.
But to others it seemed, and more truly, a policy of faith;
not, indeed, of thoughtless optimism, but of faith according
to the definition which calls it &quot;the substance of things
hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.&quot; Faith, by
which nations as well as men must live, means nothing less
than a conviction that great principles, permanent truths of
human nature, lie at the bottom of all sound politics, and
ought to be boldly and consistently applied, even when
temporary difficulties surround their application. Such a
principle is the belief in the power of freedom and self-government
to cure the faults of a nation, in the tendency of re<!-- Page 243 --><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243" />sponsibility
to teach wisdom, and to make men see that
justice and order are the surest sources of prosperity. Such a
principle is the perception that national hatreds do not live
on of themselves, but will expire when oppression has ceased,
as a fire burns out without fuel. Such a principle is the
recognition of the force of national sentiment, and of the duty
of allowing it all the satisfaction that is compatible with
the maintenance of imperial unity. Such, again, is the appreciation
of those natural economic laws which show that
nations, when disturbing passions have ceased, follow their
own permanent interests, and that an island which finds its
chief market in England and draws its capital from England
will prefer a connection with England to the poverty and
insignificance of isolation. It is the honour of Mr. Gladstone
to have built his policy of conciliation upon principles like
these, as upon a rock; and already the good effects are
seen in the new friendliness which has arisen between the
English masses and the people of Ireland, and in the better
temper with which, despite the acrimony of some prominent
politicians, the relations of the two peoples are discussed.
When one looks round the horizon it is still far from clear;
nor can we say from which quarter fair weather will arrive.
But the air is fresher, and the clouds are breaking overhead.</p>

<p>POSTSCRIPT.</p>

<p>What has happened since the above paragraphs were
written, ten months ago, has confirmed more quickly and
completely than the writer expected the forecasts they
contain. Home Rule is no longer a word of terror, even
to those English and Scotch voters who were opposed to it
in July, 1886. Most sensible men in the Tory and Dissentient
Liberal camps have come to see that it is inevitable;
<!-- Page 244 --><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244" />and, while they continue to resist it for the sake of what
is called consistency, or because they do not yet see in
what form it is to be granted, they are disposed to regard
its speedy arrival as the best method of retreat from an
indefensible position.</p>

<p>The repressive policy which the present Ministry are
attempting in Ireland&mdash;for in the face of their failures one
cannot say that they are carrying out any policy&mdash;is rendering
Coercion Acts more and more detested by the English
people. The actualities of Ireland, the social condition
of her peasantry, the unwisdom of the dominant caste,
the incompetence of the bureaucracy which affects to
rule her, are being, by the full accounts we now receive,
brought home to the mind of England and Scotland as they
never were before, and produce their appropriate effect
upon the heart and conscience of the people. The recognition
by the Liberal party of the rights of Ireland, the visits
of English Liberals to Ireland, the work done by Irishmen
in English constituencies, are creating a feeling of unity and
reciprocal interest between the masses of the people on
both sides of the Channel without example in the seven
hundred years that have passed since Strongbow's landing.</p>

<p>This was the thing most needed to make Home Rule
safe and full of promise, because it affords a guarantee that
in such political contests as may arise in future, the division
will not be, as heretofore, between the Irish people on the
one side and the power of Britain on the other, but between
two parties, each of which will have adherents in both
islands. We may now at last hope that national hatreds
will vanish; that England will unlearn her arrogance and
Ireland her suspicion; that the basis is being laid for a
harmonious co-operation of both nations in promoting the
welfare and greatness of a common Empire.</p>

<p>Many of the Irish patriots of 1798 and 1848 desired
Separation, because they thought that Ireland, attached to<!-- Page 245 --><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245" />
England, could never be more than the obscure satellite of
a greater State. When Ireland has been heartily welcomed
by the democracy of Great Britain as an equal partner, the
ground for any such desire will have disappeared, and Union
will rest on a foundation firmer than has ever before existed.
Ireland will feel, when those rights of self-government have
been secured for which she has pleaded so long, that she
owes them, not only to her own tenacity and courage, but
to the magnanimity, the justice, and the freely given
sympathy of the English and Scottish people.</p>

<p>It is a favourite line of argument to show that we have no
choice between the maintenance of the Union and the
concession to Ireland of national independence. The evils
of Irish independence are universally reckoned by Englishmen
to be so intolerable that we shall never agree to it.
The evils of Home Rule are even more intolerable still.
Therefore, it is said, if we shall never willingly bring the
latter upon our heads, <i>&agrave; fortiori</i> we ought on no account
to invite the former. The business in hand, however, is not
a theorem, but a problem; it is not a thesis to be proved,
but a malady to be cured; and the world will thank only
the reasoner who winds up, not with Q.E.D., but with
Q.E.F. To reason that a patient ought not to take a given
medicine because it may possibly cause him more pain than
some other medicine which he has no intention of taking, is
curiously oblique logic. The question is not oblique; it is
direct. Will the operation do more harm to his constitution
than the slow corrosions of a disorder grown inveterate?
Are the conditions of the connection between
<!-- Page 247 --><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247" />England and Ireland, as laid down in the Act of Union,
incapable of improvement? Is the present working of these
conditions more prosperous and hopeful, or happier for
Irish order and for English institutions, than any practicable
proposal that it is within the compass of statesmanship to
devise, and of civic sense to accept and to work? That is
the question.</p>

<p>Some people contend that the burden of making out
a case rests on the advocate of change, and not on those
who support things as they are. But who supports things
as they are? Things as they are have become insupportable.
If you make any of the constitutional changes that
have been proposed, we are told, parliamentary government,
as Englishmen now know it, is at an end; and our critic
stands amazed at those &quot;who deem it a slighter danger
to innovate on the Act of Union than to remodel the
procedure of the House of Commons.&quot; As if that were the
alternative. Great changes in the rules may do other good
things, but no single competent authority believes that in
this particular they will do the thing that we want. We
cannot avoid constitutional changes. It is made matter of
crushing rebuke that the Irish proposals of the late Government
were an innovation on the old constitution of the
realm. But everybody knows that, while ancient forms
have survived, the last hundred years have witnessed a long
succession of silent but most profound innovations. It was
shortsighted to assume that the redistribution of political
power that took place in 1884-5 was the last chapter of the
history of constitutional change. It ought to have been
foreseen that new possessors of power, both Irish and
British, would press for objects the pursuit of which would
certainly involve further novelties in the methods and
machinery of government. Every given innovation must
be rigorously scrutinized, but in the mere change or in the
fact of innovation there is no valid reproach. When one of
<!-- Page 248 --><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248" />the plans for the better government of Ireland is described
as depriving parliamentary institutions of their elasticity and
strength, as weakening the Executive at home, and lessening
the power of the country to resist foreign attack, no careful
observer of the events of the last seven years can fail to see
that all this evil has already got its grip upon us. Mr. Dicey
himself admits it. &quot;Great Britain,&quot; he says, &quot;if left to
herself, could act with all the force, consistency, and energy
given by unity of sentiment and community of interests.
The obstruction and the uncertainty of our political aims,
the feebleness and inconsistency with which they are pursued,
arise in part at least from the connection with Ireland.&quot;
So then, after all, it is feebleness and inconsistency, not
elasticity and strength, that mark our institutions as they
stand; feebleness and inconsistency, distraction and uncertainty.
The supporter of things as they are is decidedly
as much concerned in making out a case as the advocate
of change.</p>

<p>The strength of the argument from Nationality is great,
and full of significance; but Nationality is not the whole
essence of either the argument from History or the argument
from Self-government. Their force lies in considerations
of political expediency as tested by practical experience.</p>

<p>The point of the argument from the lessons of History is
that for some reason or another the international concern,
whose unlucky affairs we are now trying to unravel, has
always been carried on at a loss: the point of the argument
from Self-government is that the loss would have been
avoided if the Irish shareholders had for a certain number
of the transactions been more influentially represented on
the Board. That is quite apart from the sentiment of pure
nationality. The failure has come about, not simply because
the laws were not made by Irishmen as such, but because
they were not made by the men who knew most about
Ireland. The vice of the connection between the two
<!-- Page 249 --><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249" />countries has been the stupidity of governing a country
without regard to the interests or customs, the peculiar
objects and peculiar experiences, of the great majority of
the people who live in it. It is not enough to say that the
failures of England in Ireland have to a great extent flowed
from causes too general to be identified with the intentional
wrong-doing either of rulers or of subjects. We readily
admit that, but it is not the point. It is not enough to
insist that James I., in his plantations and transplantations,
probably meant well to his Irish subjects. Probably
he did. That is not the question. If it is &quot;absolutely
certain that his policy worked gross wrong,&quot; what is the
explanation and the defence? We are quite content with
Mr. Dicey's own answer. &quot;Ignorance and want of sympathy
produced all the evils of cruelty and malignity. An
intended reform produced injustice, litigation, misery, and
discontent. The case is noticeable, for it is a type of a
thousand subsequent English attempts to reform and improve
Ireland.&quot; This description would apply, with hardly
a word altered, to the wrong done by the Encumbered
Estates Act in the reign of Queen Victoria. That memorable
measure, as Mr. Gladstone said, was due not to the
action of a party, but to the action of a Parliament. Sir
Robert Peel was hardly less responsible for it than Lord
John Russell. &quot;We produced it,&quot; said Mr. Gladstone,
&quot;with a general, lazy, uninformed, and irreflective good
intention of taking capital to Ireland. What did we do?
We sold the improvements of the tenants&quot; (House of
Commons, April 16). It is the same story, from the first
chapter to the last, in education, poor law, public works,
relief Acts, even in coercion Acts&mdash;lazy, uninformed, and
irreflective good intention. That is the argument from
history. When we are asked what good law an Irish
Parliament would make that could not equally well be
made by the Parliament at Westminster, this is the answer.<!-- Page 250 --><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250" />
It is not the will, it is the intelligence, that is wanting. We
all know what the past has been. Why should the future
be different?</p>

<p>&quot;It is an inherent condition of human affairs,&quot; said Mill
in a book which, in spite of some chimeras, is a wholesome
corrective of the teaching of our new jurists, &quot;that no intention,
however sincere, of protecting the interests of others
can make it safe or salutary to tie up their own hands.
Still more obviously true is it, that by their own hands only
can any positive and durable improvement of their circumstances
in life be worked out&quot; (<i>Repres. Government</i>, p. 57).
It is these wise lessons from human experience to which the
advocate of Home Rule appeals, and not the wild doctrine
that any body of persons claiming to be united by a sense
of nationality possesses <i>an inherent and divine right</i> to be
treated as an independent community. It is quite true that
circumstances sometimes justify a temporary dictatorship.
In that there is nothing at variance with Liberalism. But
the Parliamentary dictatorship in Ireland has lasted a great
deal too long to be called temporary, and its stupid shambling
operations are finally and decisively condemned by their
consequences. That is a straightforward utilitarian argument,
and has nothing whatever to do with inherent and
divine rights, or any other form of political moonshine.</p>

<p>There are some who believe that an honest centralized
administration of impartial officials, and not Local Self-Government,
would best meet the real wants of the people.
In other words, everything is to be for the people, nothing
by the people&mdash;which has not hitherto been a Liberal principle.
Something, however, may be said for this view,
provided that the source of the authority of such an
administration be acceptable. Austrian administration in
Lombardy was good rather than bad, yet it was hated and
resisted because it was Austrian and not Italian. No
rational person can hold for an instant that the source of
<!-- Page 251 --><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251" />a scheme of government is immaterial to its prosperity.
More than that, when people look for success in the government
of Ireland to &quot;honest centralized administration,&quot; we
cannot but wonder what fault they find with the administration
of Ireland to-day in respect of its honesty or its
centralization. What administration ever carried either
honesty or centralization to a higher pitch than the Irish
administration of Mr. Forster? What could be less successful?
Those who have been most directly concerned in the
government of Ireland, whether English or Irish, even while
alive to the perils of any other principle, habitually talk of
centralization as the curse of the system. Here, again, why
should we expect success in the future from a principle that
has so failed in the past?</p>

<p>Again, how are we to get a strong centralized administration
in the face of a powerful and hostile parliamentary
representation? It is very easy to talk of the benefits that
might have been conferred on Ireland by such humanity
and justice as was practised by Turgot in his administration
of the Generality of Limoges. But Turgot was not confronted
by eighty-six Limousin members of an active
sovereign body, all interested in making his work difficult,
and trusted by a large proportion of the people of the
province with that as their express commission. It is
possible to have an honest centralized administration of
great strength and activity in India, but there is no Parliament
in India. If India, or any province of it, ever gets
representative government and our parliamentary system,
from that hour, if there be any considerable section of
Indian feeling averse from European rule, the present
administrative system will be paralyzed, as the preliminary
to being revolutionized. It is conceivable, if any one
chooses to think so, that a body of impartial officials could
manage the national business in Ireland much better without
the guidance of public opinion and common sentiment
<!-- Page 252 --><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252" />than with it. But if you intend to govern the country as
you think best&mdash;and that is the plain and practical English
of centralized administration&mdash;why ask the country to send
a hundred men to the great tribunal of supervision to inform
you how it would like to be governed? The Executive cannot
set them aside as if they were a hundred dummies; in
refusing to be guided, it cannot escape being harassed, by
them. You may amend procedure, but that is no answer,
unless you amend the Irish members out of voice and vote.
They will still count. You cannot gag and muzzle them
effectually, and if you could, they would still be there, and
their presence would still make itself incessantly felt. Partly
from a natural desire to lessen the common difficulties of
government, and partly from a consciousness, due to the
prevailing state of the modern political atmosphere, that
there is something wrong in this total alienation of an
Executive from the possessors of parliamentary power, the
officials will incessantly be tempted to make tacks out of
their own course; and thus they lose the coherency and
continuity of absolutism without gaining the pliant strength
of popular government. This is not a presumption of what
would be likely to happen, but an account of what does
happen, and what justified Mr. Disraeli in adding a weak
Executive to the alien Church and the absentee aristocracy,
as the three great curses of Ireland. Nothing has occurred
since 1844 to render the Executive stronger, but much to
the contrary. There is, and there can be, no weaker or less
effective Government in the world than a highly centralized
system working alongside of a bitterly inimical popular
representation. I say nothing of the effect of the fluctuations
of English parties on Irish administration. I say
nothing of the tendency in an Irish government, awkwardly
alternating with that to which I have just adverted, to look
over the heads of the people of Ireland, and to consider
mainly what will be thought by the ignorant public in<!-- Page 253 --><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253" />
England. But these sources of incessant perturbation must
not be left out. The fault of Irish centralization is not
that it is strong, but that it is weak. Weak it must remain
until Parliament either approves of the permanent suspension
of the Irish writs, or else devises constitutional
means for making Irish administration responsible to Irish
representatives.</p>

<p>If experience is decisive against the policy of the past,
experience too, all over the modern world, indicates the
better direction for the future. I will not use my too scanty
space in repeating any of the great wise commonplaces in
praise of self-government. Here they are superfluous.
In the case of Ireland they have all been abundantly
admitted in a long series of measures, from Catholic
Emancipation down to Lord O'Hagan's Jury Law and the
Franchise and Redistribution Acts of a couple of years ago.
The principle of self-government has been accepted, ratified,
and extended in a hundred ways. It is only a question of
the form that self-government shall take. Against the form
proposed by the late Ministry a case is built up that rests
on a series of prophetic assumptions. These assumptions,
from the nature of the case, can only be met by a counter-statement
of fair and reasonable probabilities. Let us
enumerate some of them.</p>

<p>1. It is inferred that, because the Irish leaders have
used violent language and resorted to objectionable expedients
against England during the last six years, they
would continue in the same frame of mind after the reasons
for it had disappeared. In other words, because they have
been the enemies of a Government which refused to listen
to a constitutional demand, therefore they would continue
to be its enemies after the demand had been listened to.
On this reasoning, the effect is to last indefinitely and
perpetually, notwithstanding the cessation of the cause.
Our position is that all the reasonable probabilities of
<!-- Page 254 --><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254" />human conduct point the other way. The surest way
of justifying violent language and fostering treasonable
designs, is to refuse to listen to the constitutional demand.</p>

<p>2. The Irish, we are told, hate the English with an
irreconcilable hatred, and would unquestionably use any
Constitution as an instrument for satisfying their master
passion. Irrational hatred, they say, can be treated by
rational men with composure. The Czechs of Bohemia are
said to be irreconcilable, yet the South Germans bear with
their hatred; and if we cannot cure we might endure the
antipathy of Ireland. Now, as for the illustration, I may
remark that the hatred of the Czechs would be much too
formidable for German composure, if the Czechs did not
happen to possess a provincial charter and a special
constitution of their own. If the Irish had the same, their
national dislike&mdash;so far as it exists&mdash;might be expected to
become as bearable as the Germans have found the feeling
of the Czechs. But how deep does Irish dislike go? Is it
directed against Englishmen, or against an English official
system? The answers of every impartial observer to the
whole group of such questions as these favour the conclusion
that the imputed hatred of England in Ireland has
been enormously exaggerated and overcoloured by Ascendency
politicians for good reasons of their own; that with
the great majority of Irishmen it has no deep roots; that
it is not one of those passionate international animosities
that blind men to their own interests, or lead them to
sacrifice themselves for the sake of injuring their foe; and,
finally, that it would not survive the amendment of the
system that has given it birth.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72" /><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a><!-- Page 255 --><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255" /></p>

<p>3. It is assumed that there is a universal desire for
Separation. That there is a strong sentiment of nationality
we of course admit; it is part of the case, and not the
worst part. But the sentiment of nationality is a totally
different thing from a desire for Separation. Scotland
might teach our pseudo-Unionists so much as that. Nowhere
in the world is the sentiment of nationality stronger,
yet there is not a whisper of Separation. That there is
a section of Irishmen who desire Separation is notorious,
but everything that has happened since the Government
of Ireland Bill was introduced, including the remarkable
declarations of Mr. Parnell in accepting the Bill (June 7),
and including the proceedings at Chicago, shows that the
separatist section is a very small one either in Ireland or
in America, and that it has become sensibly smaller since,
and in consequence of, the proposed concession of a
limited statutory constitution. The Irish are quite shrewd
enough to know that Separation, if it were attainable&mdash;and
they are well aware that it is not&mdash;would do no good
to their markets; and to that knowledge, as well as to
many other internal considerations, we may confidently
look for the victory of strong centripetal over very weak
centrifugal tendencies. Even if we suppose these centrifugal
tendencies to be stronger than I would allow them to be,
how shall we best resist them&mdash;by strengthening the hands
and using the services of the party which, though nationalist,
is also constitutional; or by driving that party also,
in despair of a constitutional solution, to swell the ranks of
Extremists and Irreconcilables?</p>

<p><!-- Page 256 --><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256" />4. Whatever may be the ill-feeling towards England, it
is at least undeniable that there are bitter internal animosities
in Ireland, and a political constitution, our opponents
argue, can neither assuage religious bigotry nor remove
agrarian discontent.</p>

<p>It is true, no doubt, that the old feud between Protestant
and Catholic might, perhaps, not instantly die down to the
last smouldering embers of it all over Ireland. But we
may remark that there is no perceptible bad blood between
Protestant and Catholic, outside of one notorious corner.
Second, the real bitterness of the feud arose from the fact
that Protestantism was associated with an exclusive and
hostile ascendency, which would now be brought to an
end. Whatever feeling about what is called Ulster exists
in the rest of Ireland, arises not from the fact that there
are Protestants in Ulster, but that the Protestants are anti-National.
Third, the Catholics would no longer be one
compact body for persecuting, obscurantist, or any other
evil purposes; the abatement of the national struggle would
allow the Catholics to fall into the two natural divisions of
Clerical and Liberal. What we may be quite sure of is that
the feud will never die so long as sectarian pretensions are
taken as good reasons for continuing bad government.</p>

<p>It is true, again, that a constitution would not necessarily
remove agrarian discontent. But it is just as true that you
will never remove agrarian discontent without a constitution.
Mr. Dicey, on consideration, will easily see why. Here
we come to an illustration, and a very impressive illustration
it is, of the impotence of England to do for Ireland the
good which Ireland might do for herself. Nobody just
now is likely to forget the barbarous condition of the broad
fringe of wretchedness on the west coast of Ireland. Of
this Lord Dufferin truly said in 1880 that no legislation
could touch it, that no alteration in the land laws could
effectually ameliorate it, and that it must continue until
<!-- Page 257 --><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257" />the world's end unless something be contrived totally to
change the conditions of existence in that desolate region.
Parliament lavishly pours water into the sieve in the shape
of Relief Acts. Even in my own short tenure of office
I was responsible for one of these terribly wasteful and
profoundly unsatisfactory measures. Instead of relief, what
a statesman must seek is prevention of this great evil and
strong root of evil; and prevention means a large, though
it cannot be a very swift, displacement of the population.
But among the many experts with whom I have discussed
this dolorous and perplexing subject, I never found one
of either political party who did not agree that a removal
of the surplus population was only practicable if carried
out by an Irish authority, backed by the solid weight of
Irish opinion. Any exertion of compulsory power by a
British Minister would raise the whole country-side in
squalid insurrection, government would become impossible,
and the work of transplantation would end in ghastly
failure. It is misleading and untrue, then, to say that there
is no possible relation between self-government and agrarian
discontent, misery, and backwardness; and when Mr.
Dicey and others tell us that the British Parliament is able
to do all good things for Ireland, I would respectfully ask
them how a British Parliament is to deal with the Congested
Districts.</p>

<p>Nearly as much may be said of the prevention of the
mischievous practice of Subdivision. Some contend that
the old disposition to subdivide is dying out; others, however,
assure us that it is making its appearance even among
the excellent class who purchased their holdings under the
Church Act. That Act did not prohibit subdivision, but
it is prohibited in the Act of 1881. Still the prohibition
can only be made effective, if operations take place on
anything like a great scale, on condition that representative,
authorities resident on the spot have the power of enforcing
<!-- Page 258 --><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258" />it, and have an interest in enforcing it. Some of the pseudo-Unionists
are even against any extension of local self-government,
and if it be unaccompanied by the creation of
a central native authority they are right. What such people
fail to see is that, in resisting political reconstruction, they
are at the same time resisting the only available remedies
for some of the worst of agrarian maladies.</p>

<p>The ruinous interplay between agrarian and political
forces, each using the other for ends of its own, will never
cease so long as the political demand is in every form
resisted. That, we are told, is all the fault of the politicians.
Be it so; then the Government must either
suppress the politicians outright, or else it must interest
them in getting the terms of its land settlement accepted
and respected. Home Rule on our scheme was, among
other things, part of an arrangement for &quot;settling the
agrarian feud.&quot; It was a means of interposing between
the Irish tenant and the British State an authority interested
enough and strong enough to cause the bargain to be kept.
It is said that the Irish authority would have had neither
interest nor strength enough to resist the forces making
for repudiation. Would those forces be any less irresistible
if the whole body of the Irish peasantry stood, as Land
Purchase <i>minus</i> Self-Government makes them to stand,
directly face to face with the British State? This is a
question that our opponents cannot evade, any more than
they can evade that other question, which lies unnoticed
at the back of all solutions of the problem by way of
peasant ownership&mdash;Whether it is possible to imagine the
land of Ireland handed over to Irishmen, and yet the
government of Ireland kept exclusively and directly by
Englishmen? Such a divorce is conceivable under a rule
like that of the British in India: with popular institutions
it is inconceivable and impossible.</p>

<p>5. It is argued that Home Rule on Mr. Gladstone's
<!-- Page 259 --><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259" />plan would not work, because it follows in some respects
the colonial system, whereas the conditions at the root of
the success of the system in the Colonies do not exist in
Ireland. They are distant, Ireland is near; they are
prosperous, Ireland is poor; they are proud of the connection
with England, Ireland resents it. But the question
is not whether the conditions are identical with those of
any colony; it is enough if in themselves they seem to
promise a certain basis for government. It might justly
be contended that proximity is a more favourable condition
than distance; without it there could not be that close and
constant intercommunication which binds the material
interests of Ireland to those of Great Britain, and so
provides the surest guarantee for union. If Ireland were
suddenly to find herself as far off as Canada, then indeed
one might be very sorry to answer for the Union. Again,
though Ireland has to bear her share of the prevailing
depression in the chief branch of her production, it is a
great mistake to suppose that outside of the margin of
chronic wretchedness in the west and south-west, the condition
not only of the manufacturing industries of the north,
but of the agricultural industry in the richer parts of the
middle and south, is so desperately unprosperous as to
endanger a political constitution. Under our stupidily [Transcriber: sic]
centralized system, Irishmen have no doubt acquired the
enervating trick of attributing every misfortune, great or
small, public or private, to the Government. When they
learn the lessons of responsibility, they will unlearn this
fatal habit, and not before.</p>

<p>I do not see, therefore, that the differences in condition
between Ireland and the Colonies make against Home
Rule. What I do see is ample material out of which would
arise a strong and predominant party of order. The bulk
of the nation are sons and daughters of a Church which has
been hostile to revolution in every country but Ireland, and
<!-- Page 260 --><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260" />which would be hostile to it there from the day that the
cause of revolution ceased to be the cause of self-government.
If the peasantry were made to realize that at last
the land settlement, wisely and equitably made, was what
it must inexorably remain, and what no politicians could
help them to alter, they would be as conservative as the
peasantry under a similar condition in every other spot
on the surface of the globe. There is no reason to expect
that the manufacturers, merchants, and shopkeepers of
Ireland would be less willing or less able to play an active
and useful part in the affairs of their country than the same
classes in England or Scotland. It will be said that this
is mere optimist prophesying. But why is that to be flung
aside under the odd name of sentimentalism, while pessimist
prophesying is to be taken for gospel?</p>

<p>The only danger is lest we should allot new responsibilities
to Irishmen with a too grudging and restrictive
hand. For true responsibility there must be real power.
It is easy to say that this power would be misused, and
that the conditions both of Irish society and of the proposed
Constitution must prevent it from being used for good.
It is easy to say that separation would be a better end.
Life is too short to discuss that. Separation is not the
alternative either to Home Rule or to the <i>status quo</i>. If
the people of Ireland are not to be trusted with real power
over their own affairs, it would be a hundred times more
just to England, and more merciful to Ireland, to take
away from her that semblance of free government which
torments and paralyzes one country, while it robs the other
of national self-respect and of all the strongest motives and
best opportunities of self-help. The <i>status quo</i> is drawing
very near to its inevitable end. The two courses then
open will be Home Rule on the one hand, and some shy
bungling underhand imitation of a Crown Colony on the
other. We shall have either to listen to the Irish repre<!-- Page 261 --><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261" />sentatives
or to suppress them. Unless we have lost all
nerve and all political faculty we shall, before many months
are over, face these alternatives. Liberals are for the first;
Tories at present incline to the second. It requires very
moderate instinct for the forces at work in modern politics
to foresee the path along which we shall move, in the interests
alike of relief to Great Britain and of a sounder national
life for Ireland. The only real question is not Whether we
are to grant Home Rule, but How.</p>

<p>Ireland for more than seven hundred years has been part
of the British territory, and has been with slight exceptions
held by English arms, or governed in the last resort from
this side the water. Scotland was a foreign country until
1603, and possessed absolute independence until 1707.
Yet, whether it was due to the standing barrier of the sea,
or whatever may have been the cause, much less was known
by Englishmen of Ireland than of Scotland. Witness the
works of Shakespeare, whose mind, unless as to book-knowledge,
was encyclop&aelig;dic, and yet who, while he seems at
home in Scotland, may be said to tell us nothing of Ireland,
unless it is that&mdash;</p>

&quot;The uncivil kerns of Ireland are in arms.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73" /><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a><br />
</p>

<p>During more recent times, the knowledge of Scotland on
this side the border, which before was greatly in advance,
has again increased in afar greater degree than the knowledge
of Ireland.</p>

<p>It is to Mr. Lecky that we owe the first serious effort,
both in his <i>Leaders of Public Opinion</i> and in his <i>History of
England in the Eighteenth Century</i>, to produce a better
<!-- Page 263 --><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263" />state of things. He carefully and completely dovetailed the
affairs of Ireland into English History, and the debt is one
to be gratefully acknowledged. But such remedies, addressing
themselves in the first instance to the lettered mind of
the country, require much time to operate upon the mass,
and upon the organs of superficial and transitory opinion,
before the final stage, when they enter into our settled and
familiar traditions. Meantime, since Ireland threatens to
absorb into herself our Parliamentary life, there is a greatly
enhanced necessity for becoming acquainted with the true
state of the account between the islands that make up the
United Kingdom, and with the likelihoods of the future in
Ireland, so far as they are to be gathered from her past
history.</p>

<p>That history, until the eighteenth century begins, has a
dismal simplicity about it. Murder, persecution, confiscation
too truly describe its general strain; and policy is on the
whole subordinated to violence as the standing instrument
of government. But after, say, the reign of William III.,
the element of representation begins to assert itself. Simplicity
is by degrees exchanged for complexity; the play of
human motives, singularly diversified, now becomes visible
in the currents of a real public life. It has for a very long
time been my habit, when consulted by young political
students, to recommend them carefully to study the characters
and events of the American Independence. Quite apart
from the special and temporary reasons bearing upon the
case, I would now add a twin recommendation to examine
and ponder the lessons of Irish history during the eighteenth
century. The task may not be easy, but the reward will
be ample.</p>

<p>The mainspring of public life had, from a venerable
antiquity, lain <i>de jure</i> within Ireland herself. The heaviest
fetter upon this life was the Law of Poynings; the most
ingenious device upon record for hamstringing legislative
<!-- Page 264 --><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264" />independence, because it cut off the means of resumption
inherent in the nature of Parliaments such as were those of
the three countries. But the Law of Poynings was an Irish
Law. Its operation effectually aided on the civil side those
ruder causes, under the action of which Ireland had lain
for four centuries usually passive, and bleeding at every pore.
The main factors of her destiny worked, in practice, from
this side the water. But from the reign of Anne, or perhaps
from the Revolution onwards,</p>

<p>
&quot;Novus s&aelig;corum nascitur ordo.&quot;<br />
</p>

<p>Of the three great nostrums so liberally applied by
England, extirpation and persecution had entirely failed,
but confiscation had done its work. The great Protestant
landlordism of Ireland<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74" /><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> had been strongly and effectually
built up. But, like other human contrivances, while it held
Ireland fast, it had also undesigned results. The repressed
principle of national life, the struggles of which had theretofore
been extinguished in blood, slowly sprang up anew in
a form which, though extremely narrow, and extravagantly
imperfect, was armed with constitutional guarantees; and,
the regimen of violence once displaced, these guarantees
were sure to operate. What had been transacted in England
under Plantagenets and Stuarts was, to a large extent,
transacted anew by the Parliament of Ireland in the
eighteenth century. That Parliament, indeed, deserves
almost every imaginable epithet of censure. It was corrupt,
servile, selfish, cruel. But when we have said all this, and
said it truly, there is more to tell. It was alive, and it was
national. Even absenteeism, that obstinately clinging curse,
though it enfeebled and distracted, could not, and did not,
annihilate nationality. The Irish Legislation was, moreover,
compressed and thwarted by a foreign executive; but even
<!-- Page 265 --><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265" />to this tremendous agent the vital principle was too strong
eventually to succumb.</p>

<p>Mr. Lecky well observes that the Irish case supplied
&quot;one of the most striking examples upon record&quot;<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75" /><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> of an
unconquerable efficacy in even the most defective Parliament.
I am, however, doubtful whether in this proposition
we have before us the whole case. This efficacy is not
invariably found even in tolerably constructed Parliaments.
Why do we find it in a Parliament of which the constitution
and the environment were alike intolerable? My answer
is, because that Parliament found itself faced by a British
influence which was entirely anti-national, and was thus
constrained to seek for strength in the principle of nationality.</p>

<p>Selfishness is a rooted principle of action in nations not
less than in single persons. It seems to draw a certain
perfume from the virtue of patriotism, which lies upon its
borders. It stalks abroad with a semblance of decency,
nay, even of excellence. And under this cover a paramount
community readily embraces the notion, that a dependent
community may be made to exist not for its own sake, but
for the sake of an extraneous society of men. With this
idea, the European nations, utterly benighted in comparison
with the ancient Greeks, founded their transmarine dependencies.
But a vast maritime distance, perhaps aided by
some filtration of sound ideas, prevented the application of
this theory in its nakedness and rigour to the American
Colonies of England. In Ireland we had not even the title
of founders to allege. Nay, we were, in point of indigenous
civilization, the junior people. But the maritime severance,
sufficient to prevent accurate and familiar knowledge, was
not enough to bar the effective exercise of overmastering
power. And power was exercised, at first from without, to
<!-- Page 266 --><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266" />support the Pale, to enlarge it, to make it include Ireland.
When this had been done, power began, in the seventeenth
century, to be exercised from within Ireland, within the
precinct of its government and its institutions. These were
carefully corrupted, from the multiplication of the Boroughs
by James I. onwards, for the purpose. The struggle became
civil, instead of martial; and it was mainly waged by agencies
on the spot, not from beyond the Channel. When the
rule of England passed over from the old violence into legal
forms and doctrines, the Irish reaction against it followed
the example. And the legal idea of Irish nationality took
its rise in very humble surroundings; if the expression
may be allowed, it was born in the slums of politics.
Ireland reached the nadir of political depression when, at
and after the Boyne, she had been conquered not merely
by an English force, but by continental mercenaries. The
ascendant Protestantism of the island had never stood so
low in the aspect it presented to this country; inasmuch
as the Irish Parliament, for the first time, I believe, declared
itself dependent upon England,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76" /><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> and either did not
desire, or did not dare, to support its champion Molyneux,
when his work asserting Irish independence was burned in
London. It petitioned for representation in the English
Parliament, not in order to uplift the Irish people, but in
order to keep them down. In its sympathies and in its
aims the overwhelming mass of the population had no
share. It was Swift who, by the <i>Drapier's Letters</i>, for the
first time called into existence a public opinion flowing
from and representing Ireland as a whole. He reasserted
the doctrine of Molyneux, and denounced Wood's halfpence
not only as a foul robbery, but as a constitutional and as a
national insult. The patience of the Irish Protestants was
tried very hard, and they were forced, as Sir Charles Duffy
states in his vivid book, to purchase the power of oppress<!-- Page 267 --><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267" />ing
their Roman Catholic fellow-countrymen at a great
price.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77" /><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Their pension list was made to provide the grants
too degrading to be tolerated in England. The Presbyterians
had to sit down under the Episcopal monopoly;
but the enjoyment of that monopoly was not left to the
Irish Episcopalians. In the time of Henry VIII. it had been
necessary to import an English Archbishop Browne<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78" /><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> and
an English Bishop Bale, or there might not have been
a single Protestant in Ireland. It was well to enrich the
rolls of the Church of Ireland with the piety and learning
of Ussher, and to give her in Bedell one name, at least,
which carries the double crown of the hero and the saint.
But, after the Restoration, by degrees the practice degenerated,
and Englishmen were appointed in numbers to the
Irish Episcopate in order to fortify and develop by numerical
force what came to be familiarly known as the English
interest. So that the Primate Boulter, during his government
of Ireland, complains<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79" /><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> that Englishmen are still less
than one-half the whole body of Bishops, although the
most important sees were to a large extent in their hands.
The same practice was followed in the higher judicial
offices. Fitzgibbon was the first Irishman who became
Lord Chancellor.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80" /><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> The Viceroy, commonly absent, was
represented by Lords Justices, who again were commonly
English; and Primate Boulter, a most acute and able man,
jealous of an Irish Speaker in that character, recommends
that the commander of the forces should take his place.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81" /><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
When, later on, the Viceroy resided, it was a rule that the
Chief Secretary should be an Englishman. On the occasion
when Lord Castlereagh was by way of exception admitted
<!-- Page 268 --><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268" />to that office, an apology was found for it in his entire
devotion to English policy and purposes. &quot;His appointment,&quot;
says Lord Cornwallis, &quot;gives me great satisfaction,
as he is so very unlike an Irishman!&quot;<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82" /><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Resources were
also found in the military profession, and among the voters
for the Union we find the names of eight<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83" /><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> English generals.</p>

<p>The arrangements under Poynings's Law, and the commercial
proscription, drove the iron ever deeper and deeper
into the souls of Irishmen. It is but small merit in the
Irish Parliament of George I. and George II., if under
these circumstances a temper was gradually formed in, and
transmitted by, them, which might one day achieve the
honours of patriotism. It was in dread of this most healthful
process, that the English Government set sedulously to
work for its repression. The odious policy was maintained
by a variety of agencies; by the misuse of Irish revenue, a
large portion of which was unhappily under their control;
by maintaining the duration of the Irish House of Commons
for the life of the Sovereign; and, worst of all, by extending
the range of corruption within the walls, through the
constant multiplication of paid offices tenable by members
of Parliament without even the check of re-election on
acceptance.</p>

<p>Thus by degrees those who sat in the Irish Houses
came to feel both that they had a country, and that their
country had claims upon them. The growth of a commercial
interest in the Roman Catholic body must have
accelerated the growth of this idea, as that interest naturally
fell into line with the resistance to the English prescriptive
laws. But the rate of progress was fearfully slow. It was
hemmed in on every side by the obstinate unyielding
pressure of selfish interests: the interest of the Established
Church against the Presbyterians; the interest of the
<!-- Page 269 --><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269" />Protestant laity, or tithe-payers, against the clergy; the
bold unscrupulous interest of a landlords' Parliament against
the occupier of the soil; which, together with the grievance
of the system of tithe-proctors, established in Ireland
through the Whiteboys the fatal alliance between resistance
to wrong and resistance to law, and supplied there the yet
more disastrous facility of sustaining and enforcing wrong
under the name of giving support to public tranquillity. Yet,
forcing on its way amidst all these difficulties by a natural
law, in a strange haphazard and disjointed method, and
by a zigzag movement, there came into existence, and by
degrees into steady operation, a sentiment native to Ireland
and having Ireland for its vital basis, and yet not deserving
the name of Irish patriotism, because its care was not for
a nation, but for a sect. For a sect, in a stricter sense than
may at first sight be supposed. The battle was not between
Popery and a generalized Protestantism, though, even if it
had been so, it would have been between a small minority
and the vast majority of the Irish people. It was not a
party of ascendency, but a party of monopoly, that ruled.
It must always be borne in mind that the Roman Catholic
aristocracy had been emasculated, and reduced to the
lowest point of numerical and moral force by the odious
action of the penal laws, and that the mass of the Roman
Catholic population, clerical and lay, remained under the
grinding force of many-sided oppression, and until long
after the accession of George III. had scarcely a consciousness
of political existence. As long as the great
bulk of the nation could be equated to zero, the Episcopal
monopolists had no motive for cultivating the good-will of
the Presbyterians, who like the Roman Catholics maintained
their religion, with the trivial exception of the
<i>Regium Donum</i>, by their own resources, and who differed
from them in being not persecuted, but only disabled. And
this monopoly, which drew from the sacred name of religion
<!-- Page 270 --><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270" />its title to exist, offered through centuries an example of
religious sterility to which a parallel can hardly be found
among the communions of the Christian world. The
sentiment, then, which animated the earlier efforts of the
Parliament might be <i>Iricism</i>, but did not become patriotism
until it had outgrown, and had learned to forswear or to
forget, the conditions of its infancy. Neither did it for a
long time acquire the courage of its opinions; for, when
Lucas, in the middle of the century, reasserted the doctrine
of Molyneux and of Swift, the Grand Jury of Dublin took
part against him, and burned his book.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84" /><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> And the Parliament,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85" /><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
prompted by the Government, drove him into exile.
And yet the smoke showed that there was fire. The infant,
that confronted the British Government in the Parliament
House, had something of the young Hercules about him.
In the first exercises of strength he acquired more strength,
and in acquiring more strength he burst the bonds that had
confined him.</p>

<p>
&quot;Es machte mir zu eng, ich mussie fort.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86" /><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a><br />
</p>

<p>The reign of George IV. began with resolute efforts of
the Parliament not to lengthen, as in England under his
grandfather, but to shorten its own commission, and to
become septennial. Surely this was a noble effort. It
meant the greatness of their country, and it meant also
personal self-sacrifice. The Parliament which then existed,
elected under a youth of twenty-two, had every likelihood of
giving to the bulk of its members a seat for life. This they
asked to change for a <i>maximum</i> term of seven years. This
from session to session, in spite of rejection after rejection in
England, they resolutely fought to obtain. It was an English
amendment which, on a doubtful pretext; changed seven
years to eight. Without question some acted under the
pressure of constituents; but only a minority of the members
<!-- Page 271 --><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271" />had constituents, and popular exigencies from such a quarter
might have been bought off by an occasional vote, and
could not have induced a war with the Executive and with
England so steadily continued, unless a higher principle had
been at work.</p>

<p>The triumph came at last; and from 1768 onwards the
Commons never wholly relapsed into their former quiescence.
True, this was for a Protestant House, constituency, and
nation; but ere long they began to enlarge their definition
of nationality. Flood and Lucas, the commanders in the
real battle, did not dream of giving the Roman Catholics
a political existence, but to their own constituents they
performed an honourable service and gave a great boon.
Those, who had insincerely supported the measure, became
the dupes of their own insincerity. In the very year of this
victory, a Bill for a slight relaxation of the penal laws was
passed, but met its death in England.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87" /><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Other Bills followed,
and one of them became an Act in 1771. A beginning had
thus been made on behalf of religious liberty, as a corollary
to political emancipation. It was like a little ray of light
piercing its way through the rocks into a cavern and supplying
the prisoner at once with guidance and with hope.
Resolute action, in withholding or shortening supply, convinced
the Executive in Dublin, and the Ministry in London,
that serious business was intended. And it appeared,
even in this early stage, how necessary it was for a fruitful
campaign on their own behalf to enlarge their basis, and
enlist the sympathies of hitherto excluded fellow-subjects.</p>

<p>It may seem strange that the first beginnings of successful
endeavour should have been made on behalf not of
the &quot;common Protestantism,&quot; but of Roman Catholics.
But, as Mr. Lecky has shown, the Presbyterians had been
greatly depressed and distracted, while the Roman Catholics
had now a strong position in the commerce of the country,
<!-- Page 272 --><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272" />and in Dublin knocked, as it were, at the very doors of the
Parliament. There may also have been an apprehension of
republican sentiments among the Protestants of the north,
from which the Roman Catholics were known to be free.
Not many years, however, passed before the softening and
harmonizing effects, which naturally flow from a struggle for
liberty, warmed the sentiment of the House in favour of the
Presbyterians.</p>

<p>A Bill was passed by the Irish Parliament in 1778,
which greatly mitigated the stringency of the penal laws.
Moreover, in its preamble was recited, as a ground for this
legislation, that for &quot;a long series of years&quot; the Roman
Catholics had exhibited an &quot;uniform peaceable behaviour.&quot;
In doing and saying so much, the Irish Parliament virtually
bound itself to do more.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88" /><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> In this Bill was contained a clause
which repealed the Sacramental Test, and thereby liberated
the Presbyterians from disqualification. But the Bill had
to pass the ordeal of a review in England, and there the
clause was struck out. The Bill itself, though mutilated,
was wisely passed by a majority of 127 to 89. Even in
this form it excited the enthusiastic admiration of Burke.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89" /><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
Nor were the Presbyterians forgotten at the epoch when,
in 1779-80, England, under the pressure of her growing
difficulties, made large commercial concessions to Ireland.
The Dublin Parliament renewed the Bill for the removal of
the Sacramental Test. And it was carried by the Irish
Parliament in the very year which witnessed in London the
disgraceful riots of Lord George Gordon, and forty-eight
years before the Imperial Parliament conceded, on this side
the Channel, any similar relief. Other contemporary signs
bore witness to the growth of toleration; for the Volunteers,
founded in 1778, and originally a Protestant body,
after a time received Roman Catholics into their ranks.
<!-- Page 273 --><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273" />These impartial proceedings are all the more honourable
to Irish sentiment in general, because Lord Charlemont, its
champion out of doors, and Flood, long the leader of the
Independent party in the Parliament, were neither of them
prepared to surrender the system of Protestant ascendency.</p>

<p>In order to measure the space which had at this period
been covered by the forward movement of liberality and
patriotism, it is necessary to look back to the early years of
the Georgian period, when Whiggism had acquired a decisive
ascendency, and the spirits of the great deep were let
loose against Popery. But the temper of proscription in the
two countries exhibited specific differences. Extravagant
in both, it became in Ireland vulgar and indecent. In
England, it was Tilburina,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90" /><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> gone mad in white satin; in
Ireland it was Tilburina's maid, gone mad in white linen.
The Lords Justices of Ireland, in 1715, recommended the
Parliament to put an end to all other distinctions in Ireland
&quot;but that of Protestant and Papist.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91" /><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> And the years that
followed seem to mark the lowest point of constitutional
depression for the Roman Catholic population in particular,
as well as for Ireland at large. The Commons, in
1715, prayed for measures to discover any Papist enlisting
in the King's service, in order that he might be expelled
&quot;and punished with the utmost severity of the law.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92" /><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
When an oath of abjuration had been imposed which prevented
nearly all priests from registering, a Bill was passed
by the Commons in 1719 for branding the letter P on
the cheek of all priests, who were unregistered, with a red-hot
iron. The Privy Council &quot;disliked&quot; this punishment,
and substituted for it the loathsome measure by which safe
guardians are secured for Eastern harems. The English
Government could not stomach this beastly proposal; and,
says Mr. Lecky,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93" /><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> unanimously restored the punishment of
<!-- Page 274 --><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274" />branding. The Bill was finally lost in Ireland, but only
owing to a clause concerning leases. It had gone to
England winged with a prayer from the Commons that it
might be recommended &quot;in the most effectual manner to
his Majesty,&quot; and by the assurance of the Viceroy in reply
that they might depend on his due regard to what was
desired.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94" /><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> In the same year passed the Act which declared
the title of the British Parliament to make laws for the
government of Ireland. On the accession of George II., a
considerable body of Roman Catholics offered an address
of congratulation. It was received by the Lords Justices
with silent contempt, and no one knows whether it ever
reached its destination. Finally, the acute state-craft of
Primate Boulter resisted habitually the creation of an &quot;Irish
interest,&quot; and above all any capacity of the Roman Catholics
to contribute to its formation; and in the first year of
George II. a clause was introduced in committee into a
harmless Bill<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95" /><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> for the regulation of elections, which disfranchised
at a single stroke all the Roman Catholic voters in
Ireland who up to that period had always enjoyed the
franchise.</p>

<p>It is painful to record the fact that the remarkable progress
gradually achieved was in no way due to British
influence. For nearly forty years from the arrival of Archbishop
Boulter in Ireland, the government of Ireland was in
the hands of the Primates. The harshness of administration
was gradually tempered, especially in the brief viceroyalty
of Lord Chesterfield; but the British policy was steadily
opposed to the enlargement of Parliamentary privilege, or
the creation of any Irish interest, however narrow its basis,
while the political extinction of the mass of the people was
complete. The pecuniary wants, however, of the Government,
extending beyond the hereditary revenue, required
a resort to the national purse. The demands which were
<!-- Page 275 --><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275" />accordingly made, and these alone, supplied the Parliament
with a vantage-ground, and a principle of life. The action
of this principle brought with it civilizing and humanizing
influences, which had become clearly visible in the early
years of George III., and which were cherished by the
war of American Independence, as by a strong current of
fresh air in a close and murky dungeon.</p>

<p>The force of principles, and the significance of political
achievements, is to be estimated in no small degree by
the slenderness of the means available to those who promote
them. And the progress brought about in the Irish Parliament
is among the most remarkable on record, because
it was effected against the joint resistance of a hostile
Executive and of an intolerable constitution. Of the three
hundred members, about two-thirds were nominated by
individual patrons and by close corporations. What was
still worse, the action of the Executive was increasingly
directed, as the pulse of the national life came to beat more
vigorously, to the systematic corruption of the Parliament
borough pensions and paid offices. In the latter part of
the century, more than one-third of the members of Parliament
were dismissible at pleasure from public emoluments.
If the base influence of the Executive allied itself with the
patriotic party, everything might be hoped. For we must
bear in mind not only the direct influence of this expenditure
on those who were in possession, but the enormous
power of expectancy on those who were not. Conversely,
when the Government were determined to do wrong, there
were no means commonly available of forcing it to do right,
in any matter that touched either religious bigotry or selfish
interest. With so miserable an apparatus, and in the face
of the ever-wakeful Executive sustained by British power,
it is rather wonderful how much than how little was effected.
I am not aware of a single case in which a measure on
behalf of freedom was proposed by British agency, and
<!-- Page 276 --><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276" />rejected by the Irish Parliament. On the other hand, we
have a long list of the achievements of that Parliament
due to a courage and perseverance which faced and overcame
a persistent English opposition. Among other exploits,
it established periodical elections, obtained the writ
of Habeas Corpus, carried the independence of the judges,
repealed the Test Act, limited the abominable expenditure
on pensions, subjected the acceptance of office from the
crown to the condition of re-election, and achieved, doubtless
with the powerful aid of the volunteers, freedom of
trade with England, and the repeal of Poynings's Act, and
of the British Act of 1719.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96" /><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>All this it did without the manifestation, either within
the walls or among the Roman Catholic population, of any
disposition to weaken the ties which bound Ireland to the
empire. All this it did; and what had the British Parliament
been about during the same period, with its vastly
greater means both of self-defence and of action? It had
been building up the atrocious criminal code, tampering in
the case of Wilkes with liberty of election, and tampering with
many other liberties; driving, too, the American Colonies
into rebellion, while, as to good legislation, the century
is almost absolutely blank, until between 1782 and 1793
we have the establishment of Irish freedom, the economical
reform of Mr. Burke, the financial reforms of Mr. Pitt, the
new libel law of Mr. Fox, and the legislative constitution
of Canada, in which both these great statesmen concurred.</p>

<p>But we have not yet reached the climax of Irish advancement.
When, in 1782 and 1783, the legislative relations
of the two countries were fundamentally rectified by the
formal acknowledgment of Irish nationality, the beginning of
a great work was accomplished; but its final consummation,
though rendered practicable and even easy, depended wholly
on the continuing good intention of the British Cabinet.
<!-- Page 277 --><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277" />The Acts of 1782 and 1783 required a supplemental arrangement,
to obviate those secondary difficulties in the working
of the two Legislatures, which supplied Mr. Pitt with his
main parliamentary plea for the Union. What was yet
more important was the completion of the scheme in
Ireland itself. And this under three great heads: (1) The
purification of Parliament by a large measure of reform;
(2) the abolition of all Roman Catholic disabilities; (3)
the establishment of a proper relation between the Legislative
and the Executive powers. It is often urged, with
cynical disregard to justice and reason, that with the
Grattan Parliament we had corruption, coercion, discontent,
and finally rebellion. But the political mischiefs, which
disfigure the brief life of the Grattan Parliament, and the
failure to obtain the two first of the three great purposes
I have named, were all in the main due to the third grand
flaw in the Irish case after 1782. I mean the false position,
and usually mischievous character, of the Irish Executive,
which, with its army of placemen and expectants in Parliament,
was commonly absolute master of the situation. Well
does Mr. Swift MacNeill,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97" /><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> in his very useful work, quote the
words of Mr. Fox in 1797: &quot;The advantages, which the form
of a free Government seemed to promise, have been counteracted
by the influence of the Executive Government, and
of the British Cabinet.&quot;</p>

<p>There were five Viceroys between 1782 and 1790.
Then came a sixth, Lord Westmoreland, the worst of them
all, whose political judgment was on a par with his knowledge
of the English language.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98" /><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> The great settlement of
1782-3 was in the main worked by men who were radically
adverse to its spirit and intention. But they were omnipotent
in their control of the unreformed. Parliament of Ireland,
more and more drenched, under their unceasing and pesti<!-- Page 278 --><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278" />lent
activity, with fresh doses of corruption. Westmoreland
and his myrmidons actually persuaded Pitt, in 1792, that
Irish Protestantism and its Parliament were unconquerably
adverse to the admission of Roman Catholics to the franchise;
but when the proposal was made from the Throne in
1793, notwithstanding the latent hostility of the Castle, the
Parliament passed the Bill with little delay, and &quot;without
any serious opposition.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99" /><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> The votes against it were one
and three on two divisions<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100" /><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> respectively. A minority of
sixty-nine supported, against the Government, a clause for
extending the measure to seats in Parliament. That clause,
lost by a majority of ninety-four, might apparently have been
carried, but for &quot;Dublin Castle,&quot; by an even larger majority.</p>

<p>I shall not here examine the interesting question, whether
the mission of Lord Fitzwilliam was wholly due to the
action of those Whig statesmen who were friendly to the
war, but disinclined to a junction with Mr. Pitt except
on condition of a fundamental change in the administration
of Ireland. Nor shall I dwell upon his sudden, swift, and
disastrous recall. But I purpose here to invite attention to
the most remarkable fact in the whole history of the Irish
Parliament. When the Viceroy's doom was known, when
the return to the policy and party of ascendency lay darkly
lowering in the immediate future, this diminutive and
tainted Irish Parliament, with a chivalry rare even in the
noblest histories, made what can hardly be called less than
a bold attempt to arrest the policy of retrogression adopted
by the Government in London. Lord Fitzwilliam was the
declared friend of Roman Catholic Emancipation, which
was certain to be followed by reform; and he had struck
a death-blow at bigotry and monopoly in the person of
their heads, Mr. Beresford and Mr. Cooke. The Bill of
Emancipation was introduced on the 12th of February,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101" /><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
with only three dissentient voices. On the 14th, when the
<!-- Page 279 --><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279" />London Cabinet had declared dissent from the proceedings
of their Viceroy without recalling him, Sir L. Parsons at
once moved an address, imploring him to continue among
them, and only postponed it at the friendly request of Mr.
Ponsonby.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102" /><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> On the 2nd of March, when the recall was a
fact, the House voted that Lord Fitzwilliam merited &quot;the
thanks of that House, and the confidence of the people.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103" /><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
On the 5th the Duke of Leinster moved, and the House of
Peers carried, a similar resolution.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104" /><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>At this epoch I pause. Here there opens a new and
disastrous drama of disgrace to England and misery to
Ireland. This is the point at which we may best learn the
second and the greatest lesson taught by the history of
Ireland in the eighteenth century. It is this, that, awful
as is the force of bigotry, hidden under the mask of religion,
but fighting for plunder and for power with all the advantages
of possession, of prescription, and of extraneous
support, there is a David that can kill this Goliath. That
conquering force lies in the principle of nationality.</p>

<p>It was the growing sense of nationality that prompted
the Irish Parliament to develop its earlier struggles for
privilege on the narrow ground into a genuine contest for
freedom, civil and religious, on a ground as broad as
Ireland, nay, as humanity at large. If there be such things
as contradictions in the world of politics, they are to be found
in nationality on the one side, and bigotry of all kinds on
the other, but especially religious bigotry, which is of all the
most baneful. Whatever is given to the first of these two
is lost to the second. I speak of a reasonable and reasoning,
not of a blind and headstrong nationality; of a nationality
which has regard to circumstances and to traditions, and
which only requires that all relations, of incorporation or
of independence, shall be adjusted to them according to
the laws of Nature's own enactment. Such a nationality
<!-- Page 280 --><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280" />was the growth of the last century in Ireland. As each
Irishman began to feel that he had a country, to which
he belonged, and which belonged to him, he was, by a
true process of nature, drawn more and more into brotherhood,
and into the sense of brotherhood, with those who
shared the allegiance and the property, the obligation
and the heritage. And this idea of country, once well conceived,
presents itself as a very large idea, and as a framework
for most other ideas, so as to supply the basis of a
common life. Hence it was that, on the coming of Lord
Fitzwilliam, the whole generous emotion of the country leapt
up with one consent, and went forth to meet him. Hence
it was that religious bigotry was no longer an appreciable
factor in the public life of Ireland. Hence it was that
on his recall, and in order to induce acquiescence in his
recall, it became necessary to divide again the host that
had, welcomed him&mdash;to put one part of it in array as
Orangemen, who were to be pampered and inflamed; and
to quicken the self-consciousness of another and larger mass
by repulsion and proscription, by stripping Roman Catholics
of arms in the face of licence and of cruelty, and, finally, by
clothing the extreme of lawlessness with the forms of law.</p>

<p>Within the last twelve months we have seen, in the streets
of Belfast, the painful proof that the work of Beresford and
of Castlereagh has been found capable for the moment of
revival. To aggravate or sustain Irish disunion, religious
bigotry has been again evoked in Ireland. If the curse be
an old one, there is also an old cure, recorded in the grand
pharmacopoeia of history; and if the abstract force of policy
and prudence are insufficient for the work, we may yet find
that the evil spirit will be effectually laid by the gentle
influence of a living and working Irish nationality. <i>Quod
faxit Deus.</i></p>

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
